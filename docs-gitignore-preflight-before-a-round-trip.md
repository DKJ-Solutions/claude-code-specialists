### A seam migration can move a consumer's lenses out of git · Docs · 2026-07-30

Found while running the teardown skill's own pre-flight instruction — *"establish whether `.claude/` is
tracked **before** running with `-Apply`"* — ahead of the first real adoption test round. The instruction
existed because `git status` proved partly blind in `davekokbwj/smartwatchbanden` on July 29. Following it
turned up something that is **not** about the repo being tested.

**Measured across both real consumers, July 30, 2026:**

| repo | `.gitignore` | consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `DaveKJohn/life-hub` | no `.claude` entry at all | the whole tree is tracked — a wrongly removed lens is one `git checkout` away |
| `davekokbwj/smartwatchbanden` | `.claude/*` with `!.claude/plugins/` | tracked **only** on the pre-seam path |

That second row is correct today and **breaks silently on migration.** The exception un-ignores
`.claude/plugins/` — the *pre-seam* location. Move the lenses to `.claude/specialists/` and they match
`.claude/*` with no exception covering them, so the tree leaves version control **without a single line of
the migration looking wrong**: every gate stays green (the readers accept the seam — that is the whole
point of [#253](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/253)), `git status` shows nothing
because they are ignored, and the teardown's undo is gone. A repo would discover it at the moment it most
needed that undo.

**So the migration is now five steps, and the new one is step 0:** add `!.claude/specialists/` and commit
it *before* moving anything. Reversed, the move lands untracked and the commit that would have captured it
has nothing to capture.

**The general form, which is the part worth keeping:** *an ignore rule written against a path is a bet that
the path will not move.* A migration is exactly when that bet is called in — and no gate in this family can
see a consumer's `.gitignore`, which is why this belongs in the operator's pre-flight rather than in a
check.

**One clearance for the upcoming test round, since that is the question the pre-flight was run for:**
`life-hub` tracks `.claude/` in full, so its round-trip has a working undo and `-Apply` is safe there. It is
`smartwatchbanden` that needs the `.gitignore` step first — and only if and when it migrates, since an
update alone leaves it on the pre-seam path, where it is tracked.
