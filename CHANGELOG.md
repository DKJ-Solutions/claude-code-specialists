# Changelog

The history of the davekjohns-workshop marketplace: under **Pull Requests** every merged branch
with its PR, under **Releases** the recorded versions. How the mechanism works (entry files,
folding) is described in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Pull Requests

Everything merged to `main` since the last release — newest at the top, one block per pull
request.

### #236 · The teardown no longer deletes a file that merely mentions `VUL-IN` · Fix · 2026-07-29

**A dry run against a real consumer found a bug that would have destroyed working configuration.** Dave
asked whether a real consumer test was possible yet; it was, read-only, and it earned its keep
immediately.

`specialists-teardown` classified a file as an unfilled scaffold if the string `VUL-IN` appeared
**anywhere** in it. Run against `davekokbwj/smartwatchbanden`, that marked `scripts/repo-config.ps1` for
removal — a file carrying real values for all eight contract functions. The only `VUL-IN` left in it sits
in the scaffold's own **docstring** (*"fill in remaining VUL-IN values"*), which a consumer has no reason
to strip. That is not an edge case: it is the **normal state of a filled-in scaffold**, so the naive rule
would have deleted the file `open-pr`, `fold-changelog`, `new-branch` and `check-roster-sync` all depend
on. The same flaw applied to lenses — an authored lens that happens to explain the scaffold convention
would have gone the same way.

The test now keys on a placeholder in a **position that only real use produces**: a `VUL-IN` inside an
assignment's *value* for `repo-config.ps1`, the *empty prefix table* for `branch-info.ps1`, an unfilled
slot *heading* for a lens.

| dry run, real consumers | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `smartwatchbanden` | 3 to remove, 23 kept | **2 to remove, 24 kept** |
| `life-hub` | 2 to remove, 26 kept | **2 to remove, 26 kept** |

Both now propose removing only the two `@`-imports, and both checkouts were verified byte-untouched
before and after every run.

**Third instance of one defect in a single day**, now generalised in
[Sylvester #15's lens](.claude/plugins/claude-specialists/specialists/05-15-extension.md) as **mention vs
use**: the roster check counted an `@`-import path as a roster row (#227), the lint gate read a marker
quoted in changelog prose as a real enumeration (#235), and this read a docstring explaining placeholders
as a placeholder. When a check's evidence is "this string appears in the file", ask what else in that file
legitimately contains it — and for a script that deletes, resolve every doubt toward keeping: a false keep
leaves clutter, a false remove destroys someone's work.

**Why no fixture caught it.** Every test scaffold was either untouched or fully rewritten; none
reproduced the real-world middle state of a scaffold whose values are filled in while its docstring stays.
The regression test now uses that exact shape, and was verified to **fail against the old heuristic**
before being trusted.

**Consequence worth stating plainly: v2.13.0 shipped with the naive test.** Anyone running the teardown
with `-Apply` from that release risks losing a configured `repo-config.ps1`. This fix is on `main` and
needs a release to reach consumers.
