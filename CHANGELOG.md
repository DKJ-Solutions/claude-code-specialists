# Changelog

Everything merged since the last release, **newest first**: **one `##` per change**, and under it two
named `###` sections answering what a reader arrives with — what the change deploys to `main`, and the PR.
The first holds the change's two audiences, the second of them under `#### What makes this change extra
special`; the tier numbers live in the parser rather than in any heading. Entries written before
August 16, 2026 carry the longer set of headings that shape replaced, and every earlier shape is read
exactly as it always was. Every release ever cut is listed in
[`releases/README.md`](releases/README.md) — each with its date, type and title, and a link to what that
release was worth. How the mechanism works (entry files, the Significance sections, folding) is described in
[`workflow-davekjohn/CONTRIBUTING.md`](workflow-davekjohn/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Each change declares its own **reach**, and per audience how much it **weighs** there — one `#### Tier N`
sub-section per tier, each closing with its score. This list does not order on it: it is a record of what
landed, so it reads in the order things landed. What the declaration decides is what the **release
documents** lead with — they rank themselves on it — and what may be released at all, because **the bump
follows the highest tier pending**: **tier 0 only earns a patch**, **tier 1 or higher earns a minor**, and
a **major** recaps ten minors. So a changelog holding nothing but tier 0 is a patch waiting to be cut, not
a release with nobody to announce it to.
