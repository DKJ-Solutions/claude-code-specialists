# Changelog

The history of the davekjohns-workshop marketplace: under **Pull Requests** every merged branch
with its PR, under **Releases** the recorded versions. How the mechanism works (entry files,
folding) is described in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Pull Requests

Everything merged to `main` since the last release Ã¢â‚¬â€ newest at the top, one block per pull
request.

### #366 · UNINSTALL names what it leaves behind, and what the leftover does · Docs · 2026-08-02

Three findings from test round v11, all in `UNINSTALL.md`, all the same shape: the page describes an
operation correctly and stops one sentence before the consequence.

**Step 2's predicted error text was stale, and the CLI now suggests the wrong remedy** (inbound #359).
On CLI `2.1.220` a scopeless `uninstall` no longer says *"not installed at scope user"* — it names the
scope and the settings file, which is an improvement, and then suggests `plugin disable --scope local`.
That is a different operation: it writes a local disable key on top of the project setting and leaves
the install in place, so Step 4's verification does not come back empty and the reader has added a key
instead of removing one. The measured message is now quoted, the CLI's own suggestion is explicitly
ruled out, and the paragraph says which part of it is version-bound — the flag is the invariant, the
wording is not.

**Step 5 did not mention that `marketplace remove` leaves an empty key** (inbound #357). It edits
`~/.claude/settings.json`, removes the `davekjohns-workshop` block, leaves `"extraKnownMarketplaces": {}`
and re-serialises the file. Step 2 already says exactly this about `"enabledPlugins": {}` and calls a
diff there the command working rather than a fault; the mirror-image sentence was simply missing. Worth
stating because it settles a question a clean-machine check keeps raising: after a by-the-book teardown
that row is never *literally* clean — the keys are empty, not absent.

**The surviving scaffold prose was listed as inert, and it is not** (inbound #362). `CLAUDE.md` is loaded
into every session as project instructions, so the two lines the bootstrap wrote keep telling later
sessions — in the channel that outranks their defaults — that the repo is governed by a system that is
no longer installed. Two separate fresh sessions flagged the contradiction unprompted. The reasoning for
keeping the lines is unchanged and still right: prose loads nothing on its own, and a script that deletes
sentences out of a governance file is doing the damage the classification exists to prevent. What changed
is that the row is now a to-do with two one-line remedies rather than a note ending in "yours to decide",
and the section's opening count moved with it — three of the five leftovers are correct, two are things
to act on.

### #365 · The kept count matches its markers, and the hook stub cannot be copied by accident · Fix · 2026-08-02

Two findings from test round v11, both in the reporting layer rather than in what the scripts do.

**`specialists-teardown` summarised itself as `0 kept` while printing two `[KEEP]` lines** (inbound
#356). The scaffold-prose loop added in #331 printed its own marker straight to the host and never
touched the `$kept` tally, so a run on the fresh-consumer row — a repo with no `CLAUDE.md` before
adoption — printed two `[KEEP]` markers, a `[note]` saying "2 line(s)", and a summary contradicting
both. The figure a reader skims to was the one that said nothing was left behind, which is precisely
the failure #331 was filed about, occurring inside the repair for it. Every `[KEEP]` marker now goes
through one `Add-Kept` door, so the markers and the number cannot drift apart — the same "one list,
one number" lesson #275 established for the remove side, applied to the half it did not reach. The
kept items carry which remedy applies to them and the summary groups by it: the `-EmptyLensPattern`
escape hatch is true of a file whose shape the script did not recognise and false of a prose line in
a governance file, so one blanket paragraph over both would have to be wrong for one of them.

**`settings.suggested.jsonc` invited copying a hook that points at nothing** (inbound #363). The
bootstrap proposes a `Stop` hook running `scripts/maintenance/lint-changed-hook.ps1`, a file it does
not create and nothing else ships. The proposal file did already say twice that its hooks are a stub
— so the gap was not the missing warning the issue reports, but where that warning is not: the
console's step 3 says "copy desired parts" with no exception named, and that console line is the
instruction a reader acts on. The path is now visibly a placeholder (`<your-check>.ps1`) rather than
a plausible-looking real one, and step 3 states which block is ready to use and which is not. Same
step also gave the file a trailing newline, which it never had — the `#337.2` warning names
`CLAUDE.md` for that and does not cover this file, so nothing pointed at it.

Regression covered on the v11 fixture itself, in both preview and apply mode, as the invariant
(every printed marker is counted) rather than against a literal count — a hardcoded expectation
could pass while both sides carried the same error, which is the failure the test exists to catch.
