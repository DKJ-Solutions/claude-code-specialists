# Changelog

Everything merged since the last release, furthest reach first: **one `##` per change**, and under it six
named `###` sections answering what a reader arrives with. Every release ever cut is listed in
[`releases/README.md`](releases/README.md) — each with its date, type and title, and a link to what that
release was worth. How the mechanism works (entry files, the Significance sections, folding) is described in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Each change declares its own **reach**, and per audience how much it **weighs** there — one `#### Tier N`
sub-section per tier under *Significance*, each closing with its score. That is what orders this list:
furthest reach first, and within a tier the most consequential change first. It also decides what may be
released, because **the bump follows the highest tier pending**: **tier 0 only earns a patch**, **tier 1 or
higher earns a minor**, and a **major** recaps ten minors. So a changelog holding nothing but tier 0 is a
patch waiting to be cut, not a release with nobody to announce it to.
