# Changelog

Everything merged since the last release, **newest first**: **one `##` per change**, and under it two
named `###` sections answering what a reader arrives with. Entries written before August 16, 2026 carry
six, and are read exactly as they always were. Every release ever cut is listed in
[`workflow-davekjohn/releases/README.md`](workflow-davekjohn/releases/README.md) — each with its date, type and title, and a link to what that
release was worth. How the mechanism works (entry files, the Significance sections, folding) is described in
[`workflow-davekjohn/CONTRIBUTING.md`](workflow-davekjohn/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Each change declares its own **reach**, and per audience how much it **weighs** there — one `#### Tier N`
sub-section per tier, each closing with its score. This list does not order on it: it is a record of what
landed, so it reads in the order things landed. What the declaration decides is what the **release
documents** lead with — they rank themselves on it — and what may be released at all, because **the bump
follows the highest tier pending**: **tier 0 only earns a patch**, **tier 1 or higher earns a minor**, and
a **major** recaps ten minors. So a changelog holding nothing but tier 0 is a patch waiting to be cut, not
a release with nobody to announce it to.
