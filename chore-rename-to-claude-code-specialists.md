### rename the marketplace to claude-code-specialists · Chore · 2026-08-03

Step 2 of the four-step rename ([#404](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/404),
tracked from [#407](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/407)). The repository was
renamed on GitHub in step 1 ([#403](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/403));
this change makes the repository's own contents agree with its new name. Marketplace name and repository
name are now identical on purpose — when they differ, you have to remember forever which marketplace
lives in which repository, and that is exactly what bites while debugging a plugin that will not load.

**Why the rename at all.** The workshop was meant to become the home for every future plugin. With one
`CHANGELOG.md`, one `vX.Y.Z` tag and a lockstep version bump, that design breaks the moment a second,
unrelated product lands: it gets bumped for work it never had, one tag covers two products, and one
changelog mixes two histories. Measurement showed there was nothing here that is *not* the specialists
product — `scripts/` is its machinery, `releases/` its notes, `CHANGELOG.md` its history, and
`claude-code-plugins/` holds only `claude-specialists/`. So this was never a split; it was a rename, and
a `git push --mirror` would have been the expensive route — it loses the issues, the pull requests, the
releases metadata, the `main` ruleset and the CI history that a rename keeps.

**What changed.** `davekjohns-workshop` → `claude-code-specialists` in 59 files, 370 replacements: the
`name` in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, every `specialists*@davekjohns-workshop` plugin ID, the
repository slug, the six live hard-coded `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/…` import paths (including
Chris's body import, which every session loads), the self-consumption entry in `.claude/settings.json`,
and the connector registry — where `connectors/davekjohns-workshop.json` was renamed with `git mv` so
its history follows it.

**What deliberately did not change.**

- `releases/**` and every `CHANGELOG.md`, root and per-plugin. These are the historical record: a note
  that says where a file stood in version 1.7.0 is true about that moment, and rewriting it would make
  it false. The one archived cache path in `releases/development/1.x/1.7.0.md` therefore still reads
  `davekjohns-workshop`, which is correct — the language-layer rule in
  [`.claude/rules/language-layers.md`](.claude/rules/language-layers.md) already names archived release
  notes as a deliberate exception.
- `scripts/release/cut-release.ps1`. The lockstep bump across all four plugins under a single tag is
  what triggered this reorganisation, but with one repository holding one product the lockstep is
  **correct** — the four plugins are one system, and a consumer running group 1 plus group 3 needs
  matching versions. The versioning problem dissolves with the rename instead of needing a fix. Recorded
  here because the obvious next move is to "repair" a script that is not broken.

**Verified.** The ruleset survived the repository rename — `main-ci-gate` is still `active` with
`lint-en-tests` required, so the CI gate and the no-`--admin` merge work unchanged. Lint gate: 0 errors
across 26 agent defs, 26 manuals, 4 personas, 148 link-scanned files and 19 checks. Test gate: 23 of 23
suites pass.

**What this does not do, and cannot.** The machine-side re-adoption — removing the old marketplace,
adding `DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists`, dropping the stale user-scope registration, and confirming a
fresh session loads Chris from the new path — needs a session restart, and an agent runs inside the
session it would have to restart. That is the same structural limit inbound
[#402](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/402) reports about the Quickstart
itself, met here rather than read about. Those four acts are the handoff, written out in the run-book
[#409](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/409).

Two consequences worth stating rather than discovering. Until that handoff runs, a session in this repo
loads no specialists at all: `.claude/settings.json` now asks for
`specialists@claude-code-specialists` while the machine still knows only the old marketplace and the old
install record. And the flattening of `claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/` is still ahead
([#405](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/issues/405)), so the import paths this
change corrected will move once more — which is why the three family-level documents move to the root in
that step rather than this one.

Closes #404.
