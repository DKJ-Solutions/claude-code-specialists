## v2.16.0 — 2026-07-30

### Documentation

#### #261 · The seam migration left stale lens paths in the prose · Docs · 2026-07-30

The seam shipped its **machinery** in v2.15.0 ([#253](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/253)
specified it, [#254](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/254) taught the bootstrap
and the teardown to write and remove it, [#255](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/255)
migrated this repo onto it). Its **prose** did not come along. Measured today: **120 occurrences of the
pre-seam lens path across 57 files**, in all four plugins — every agent def, every manual, `QUICKSTART.md`,
the family README, the connectors README, and the shared `agent-shared/inbound-behaviour.md` block that
is filled verbatim into 19 agent defs.

That is not cosmetic. Those texts are the instruction a specialist reads *while working in a consuming
repo*: "repo-specific additions belong in the repo lens
(`.claude/plugins/claude-specialists/<plugin>/<group>-<id>-extension.md`)". A specialist who follows it
writes a file the seam does not hold and `check-roster-sync` reports as off-path.

**Why no gate caught it.** Two independent reasons, and both are worth keeping:

1. **The paths appear in prose and in code spans, not as links.** The dead-link scan resolves link
   *targets*; it never reads a label or a backticked path. So a document may describe a layout that no
   longer exists and stay green.
2. **In this repo's own `.claude/specialists/`, the labels were wrong while the targets were right.**
   `README.md` was still titled `# .claude/plugins/claude-specialists`, its layout section still
   described `plugins/claude-specialists/specialists/`, and its whole index table used
   `specialists/<id>-extension.md` labels over `lenses/<id>-extension.md` targets. Every link resolved.
   Exactly the class [#260](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/260) named a day
   earlier: the description and the thing described drift apart, and nothing announces it.

**History is left alone.** The per-plugin `CHANGELOG.md` files and the archived release notes keep the
pre-seam path — they record what was true then, and this repo does not rewrite history (the same
reasoning that lets those notes keep their original language). Two analytical mentions are also kept
deliberately, because the old path is their *subject* rather than their instruction: the teardown-gap
bullet in the family README (now marked settled) and the #227 lesson in
[Sylvester's lens](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/blob/main/.claude/specialists/lenses/05-15-extension.md), where the citation now says which
path the bootstrap wrote at the time.

**Two things found while chasing the prose, both bigger than a path:**

- **`sync-roster` still writes to the pre-seam path** — a real defect, not a wording slip, and split off
  to its own `fix/` branch rather than buried here. Its `SKILL.md` line is therefore the one stale path
  left in this diff: the doc follows the behaviour, not the other way round.
- **`specialists-init`'s SKILL.md still carried the claim [#215](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/issues/215)
  disproved** — *"what a plugin cannot do is inject always-on main-loop context"*. The family README has
  carried the correction since July 29; the skill a consumer actually reads did not. Corrected with a
  pointer to both, and stating that the switch is deliberately off — the wording was wrong regardless of
  whether Dave ever flips it.

Also reworded: "on the plugin path" as a *description of the seam*, in `QUICKSTART.md` (3),
`specialists-init/SKILL.md` (3) and the connectors README (1). The seam is not the plugin path — that
was the point of moving it, so calling it that undoes the sentence.

**One regression the sweep would have introduced, caught on the copy-edit pass.** Every agent def and
manual tells its specialist where the repo lens lives, with a fallback: *"or the legacy path
`.claude/extensions/…`"*. Before the sweep that sentence named the **pre-seam plugin path** as the
primary and the pre-plugin-path one as the fallback; a naive replacement left it naming the seam and the
oldest path while dropping the middle one — which is exactly where the two un-migrated consumers
(`life-hub`, `smartwatchbanden`) keep their lenses today. A specialist reading only the new sentence
would look in two places and miss the one holding the file. `Get-LensDirCandidates` reads all three
regardless, so no check would have failed. The parenthetical now names both fallbacks in one shape across
all 27 files: *"or, if this repo has not migrated to the seam, at its pre-seam
`.claude/plugins/<family>/<plugin>/` or `.claude/extensions/` location"*. **A mechanical replacement
inherits the old sentence's assumptions — read what the sentence claimed, not just the token you
changed.**

**Found and deliberately left alone:** `check-consumer-drift` reports `03-02-extension.md` (Bianca) as
`[DRIFTED]` — her lens carries a body copy instead of following the lens-only model. Informational, it
does not affect the exit code, and it predates this branch: she was adopted onto the roster on July 28,
2026. Recorded here so it is on the record rather than in a session.

## v2.7.2 — 2026-07-26

### Fixes

#### #192 · Correct stale counts, enumerations and a legacy path across lenses and READMEs · Fix · 2026-07-26

A repo-wide documentation audit found eight stale counts, enumerations, and one wrong path, all of
the same kind: the repo grew and the surrounding text did not grow with it. Each was verified
against the actual repo state (agent-def counts, test-file counts, hook registrations, script
signatures) before correcting.

**The two findings that could actually mislead a specialist into a wrong action:** Ravi #24's own
repo lens — his tool for tracking duplicated behavioral rules — named only 4 shared blocks with 3 of
4 counts wrong, when there are 11 shared blocks sourced under `agent-shared/` (`inbound-behaviour`
and `laziness-automation` in all 26 agent defs, `language-behavior` in all but Rebecca's deliberate
local variant, plus `no-conversation-history`, `no-commit-push-pr`, `browser-compatibility`,
`webcontent-boundary`, `changelog-entry-boundary`, `design-owner-boundary`,
`storefront-preview-boundary`, and `artifact-publishing-boundary`) — a sweep against the old text
would have missed seven of them. Chris #01's own repo lens listed the callable-but-unrostered rest of
the `specialists` plugin as four names (Paula, Vera, Gwen, Cody), omitting Auden #30 (the
Academic & Long-form Writer) even though `CLAUDE.md` already counts "those five callable subagents" —
exactly the kind of gap that could make Chris conclude no specialist covers long-form/academic
writing and improvise one, against the rule that new specialists are never invented on his own
initiative.

**Also corrected, lower-stakes but still wrong:** Tycho #18's lens described the test suite as having
"only just begun" with one member, when `scripts/tests/` now holds 15 suites covering nearly
everything Sylvester's lens lists — left as-is, that text would have had Tycho treat well-tested
ground as backlog. Liam's agent-def (`specialists-shopify`) pointed to Gwen's style guide via only
the legacy path `.claude/extensions/04-12-extension.md`, the one cross-reference among all 26 agent
defs that didn't also carry the current plugin path — a consumer that never adopted the legacy layout
would follow it to a file that may not exist. The root `README.md` still said "two" informational
SessionStart hooks, naming only `connector-sessioncheck` and `roster-sessioncheck`, when `hooks.json`
registers a third, `script-contract-sessioncheck` (`CLAUDE.md` already had all three). The family
README undercounted the shared-block circle twice over: "the inbound rule even across all 19" (it's
26, and `laziness-automation` shares that same full reach, so the sentence no longer marked anything
as distinctive), and a "Current blocks" list naming 6 of the 11. Rendall #06's lens listed
`cut-release.ps1` and `fold-changelog-entry.ps1` without their `-SkipLint` and `-RepoRoot` flags
respectively, and the `fold-changelog` skill — which travels to every consumer — likewise omitted
`-RepoRoot`.

**A deliberate judgment call on the two heaviest sections (Ravi's and Tycho's):** rather than
re-hardcoding fresh counts that would only go stale again at the next agent-def or test suite added,
both now name the blocks/suites themselves and point at a live way to re-check the count (a search
over the sentinel, or `Get-ChildItem scripts/tests/*.tests.ps1`) — the same kind of drift this
finding exists to stop from recurring.

**Left alone:** `specialists/scripts/README.md`'s mirrored-script count mismatch is Sylvester #15's
terrain (script/README boundary), not touched here.

## v2.0.2 — 2026-07-23

### Maintenance

#### #154 · Flatten release notes into per-major folders · Chore · 2026-07-23

Flattens the release-notes layout from per-minor folders
(`releases/development/<X.Y>/<X.Y.Z>.md`) to one folder per major
(`releases/development/<X>.x/<X.Y.Z>.md`) — so all 1.x notes now live in `1.x/` and all 2.x notes
in `2.x/`, matching the per-major grouping already applied to the overview table (#152). The 27
existing 1.x notes and the two 2.x notes were moved via `git mv` (renames preserved); the empty
minor folders are gone.

Because the depth is unchanged (a single `<X>.x` folder replaces the single `<X.Y>` folder), the
root-relative links inside the notes (`../../../`) keep resolving — no note body was touched.
Updated: `cut-release.ps1` + `release-lib.ps1` now derive `<major>.x` (was `<major>.<minor>`); the
29 note-path links in `releases/README.md` + the `## Releases` block in `CHANGELOG.md`, the four
per-plugin `RELEASE.md` cards, the descriptive `<X.Y>` references in `README.md`/`05-06-extension.md`,
and the `release-lib` test's expected paths. Git tags (`vX.Y.Z`) are unaffected — they point to
commits, not paths. Archived note bodies keep their original (historical, sometimes Dutch) path
mentions on purpose. Lint gate green (dead-link scan clean); all test suites pass.

## v1.17.0 — 2026-07-22

### Features

#### #143 · New specialists-ecomm plugin with three e-commerce specialists (SEO, CRO, SEA) · Feat · 2026-07-22

New fourth domain group — the plugin `specialists-ecomm`, for commercial webshop repos of any
platform (not Shopify-only) — with its first three specialists, all group 06 (the
measure-and-optimize family):

- **Sergio 📈 #26 — SEO Specialist.** Technical/on-site SEO: anchor links and internal linking,
  canonical tags, structured data (schema.org/JSON-LD), XML sitemaps, and pagespeed. Auditor and
  builder: measure first, fix at the source, validate, white-hat only.
- **Craig 🎯 #27 — CRO Specialist.** Conversion Rate Optimization: funnel/drop-off analysis, A/B
  experiments, checkout and landing-page optimization. Test, don't guess — keep only what a measured
  experiment proves.
- **Sean 💸 #28 — Performance / SEA Specialist.** The paid side of acquisition and its in-repo
  footprint: conversion tracking, product feeds, UTM conventions, ad-to-landing-page alignment.
  Honest about the boundary that live campaigns live in the ad platforms, and coordinates with
  Sergio so paid doesn't cannibalize organic.

All three carry the standard shared blocks (inbound-behaviour, laziness-automation,
language-behavior), defer visual/front-end changes to the design owner, and defer any preview/live
push to the platform's store owner.

**Rename to free the name for the SEA pun:** the existing Security Engineer **Sean 🛡️ #23** is
renamed to **Sebastian** (keeps 🛡️, #23, and its call name changes `@specialists:sean` →
`@specialists:sebastian`), so the new SEA specialist can be "Sean". Updated across the living
team-definition surfaces — the #23 agent def, manual, and repo lens; the roster in `CLAUDE.md`; the
family handbook; Chris's routing/chains lens; and the cross-references in the Ravi/Victor/Edith
lenses; plus the group-1 listing in `README.md`. History (CHANGELOG/releases, the dated security
baseline) and past-advice attribution comments in scripts/hooks/tests/CI are deliberately left as
records.

- **New plugin:** `claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/specialists-ecomm/` with `plugin.json`
  (version 1.16.0, lockstep), `CHANGELOG.md`, and `RELEASE.md` card; registered as the fourth entry
  in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- **Specialists:** agent defs `agents/06-26|27|28-agent.md` and portable manuals
  `manuals/06-26|27|28-manual.md`.
- Group deliberately set up to grow further (lifecycle/email, analytics) without restructuring.

**Quality-round follow-ups (Victor/Edith/Sebastian/Ravi/Nolan on the diff):**
- Registered the new plugin in the docs that describe the family — root `README.md`, the family
  `README.md`, and `QUICKSTART.md` now say "four plugins" and list `specialists-ecomm`; reframed
  "a repo needs at most one domain group" as **complementary** (a Shopify repo can enable
  `specialists-shopify` + `specialists-ecomm`).
- Fixed a real functional gap: `check-consumer-drift.ps1` hardcoded three plugins, so a consumer's
  drift check would never cover ids 26/27/28 — added `specialists-ecomm`.
- Language norm: translated the three pre-existing Dutch manifests (`marketplace.json` + the
  `specialists`/`lifehub`/`shopify` `plugin.json`) to English, closing the mixed-language state
  instead of extending it; generalized stale "three plugins" wording in scripts and lenses.
- Ravi: promoted three verbatim-shared boundaries across the ecomm agent-defs to `agent-shared/`
  blocks (`design-owner-boundary`, `changelog-entry-boundary`, `storefront-preview-boundary`),
  scoped to Sergio/Craig/Sean.

Verified: `build-agent-defs.ps1 -Check` (shared blocks in sync), `check-plugin-integrity.ps1`
(0 errors), and all test suites green.

## v1.15.0 — 2026-07-21

### #126 · Shopify theme work is dev-first (shopify theme dev); a pushed preview theme is the fallback · Feat · 2026-07-21

Shopify theme work is now framed dev-first in the core doctrine: theme work is by default developed
and tested locally via `shopify theme dev`; a pushed preview theme is the fallback, used only when
something demonstrably can't be tested through the dev server (e.g. Shopify Markets/currency-specific
behavior, or a third-party integration that needs the real published storefront). Updated in
[Sandra #21](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/blob/main/claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/specialists-shopify/manuals/05-21-manual.md)
(primary owner of the preview/push flow),
[Steven #22](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/blob/main/claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/specialists-shopify/manuals/05-22-manual.md)
(CLI reference — repositions `shopify theme dev` as the default workflow), and
[Liam #20](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/blob/main/claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/specialists-shopify/manuals/04-20-manual.md)
(the theme builder — builds and tests dev-first, with the preview push as the fallback), so the
doctrine runs consistently across both the build and the push role. The live-theme,
preview-cleanup, and cross-browser hard rules are unchanged; only the default order (dev server
before a preview push) changes. Lands inbound issue #124 (from smartwatchbanden); the issue named
Sandra #21 and Steven #22, and Liam #20 (the builder) was folded in by decision so the doctrine runs
across the build role too.

### #123 · Translate the GEGENEREERD, bewerk sentinel marker to English across the agent defs · Docs · 2026-07-21

Translated the last Dutch fragment in the agent-def shared-block sentinel comments to English, in
line with the repo-wide English-content norm: `<!-- BEGIN shared:NAME -- GEGENEREERD, bewerk
agent-shared/NAME.md -->` becomes `<!-- BEGIN shared:NAME -- GENERATED, edit agent-shared/NAME.md
-->`. The marker is literal per-file text (the generator preserves the BEGIN/END sentinel lines
as-is and only fills the body between them), so all 21 agent-defs across the three plugins were
updated directly, plus the one docstring example in `agent-shared-lib.ps1` and the one test
fixture string in `agent-shared.tests.ps1`. No regex in the generator or the lint gate matched the
Dutch text, so nothing there needed changing. Verified: `build-agent-defs.ps1 -Check` (in sync),
`check-plugin-integrity.ps1` (0 errors), and all `scripts/tests/*.tests.ps1` suites green.

## v1.14.0 — 2026-07-21

### #121 · Make the automation-first (lazy) rule a plugin-owned shared block, like inbound-behaviour · Feat · 2026-07-21

The automation-first ("stay lazy") behavioral rule is now plugin-owned via a new shared block,
`claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/agent-shared/laziness-automation.md`, wired into the
subagent agent-defs via `<!-- BEGIN/END shared:... -->` sentinels — the same circle as
`shared:inbound-behaviour` — so the rule travels along to consuming repos instead of living only
in this repo's own `CLAUDE.md`. The per-specialist "X is lazy" examples in the manuals stay in
place as elaboration; `CLAUDE.md`'s own "Shared trait — all of them incredibly lazy" paragraph
remains as the governance narrative for the main loop (Chris and the main-loop personas, who carry
no agent-shared blocks), with a light note added that it is the same rule carried by every
specialist's shared playbook, not a second canonical copy.

### #120 · Cross-browser compatibility as a standard rule for the browser-facing builders · Feat · 2026-07-21

New shared behavioral rule for the browser-facing builders: what they build must work in all major
browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), not only the one they happened to preview in. Landed as a
new canonical source block, `claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/agent-shared/browser-compatibility.md`,
carried into the agent defs of the four specialists who share it — Gwen #12 (Front-End Designer),
Liam #20 (Liquid Developer), Cody #13 (App Developer), Vera #11 (Data Analyst) — via the existing
`agent-shared/` sentinel mechanism, plus a matching prose paragraph in each of their portable
manuals (`04-12-manual.md`, `specialists-shopify/manuals/04-20-manual.md`, `04-13-manual.md`,
`04-11-manual.md`) describing the cross-browser check in that specialist's own context.

## v1.13.0 — 2026-07-21

### #119 · Ship a per-plugin RELEASE.md card so consumers see which release they are on · Feat · 2026-07-21

Every plugin now carries a `RELEASE.md` card (version, one-line summary, and the entries for that
version) right next to its `CHANGELOG.md`. Chosen approach: **Model A, plugin-authored** — the card
lives inside the plugin folder and travels with the plugin cache via `claude plugin update`, so a
consumer can see exactly which release they're on without cross-referencing the workshop's own
`releases/` history. `cut-release.ps1` (re)generates the card for every plugin, in lockstep, on
every release; the lint gate's new check 9 guards that the card is present and its `vX.Y.Z` matches
that plugin's `plugin.json`. Deliberately **no SessionStart hook** announces this — the card is
discovered by opening the file in the plugin cache. Seeded on v1.12.1.

### #117 · English names for agent-shared blocks + script-comment translations · Docs · 2026-07-21

Completed the in-progress English-norm cleanup of the agent-shared machinery. Renamed the four verbatim-shared source blocks to English file names (`grens-inbound` → `inbound-behaviour`, `gedrag-taalkeuze` → `language-behavior`, `grens-webcontent` → `webcontent-boundary`, `grens-artifact-publish` → `artifact-publishing-boundary`) and pulled the whole chain along: the `shared:<name>` sentinels in all 21 agent defs across the three plugins, the generator-lib docstring, and the current-doc references in `README.md` and Ravi's lens. Also folded in the NL→EN comment translation of `connector-sessioncheck.ps1` and `bootstrap.ps1`. Functional/canonical markers deliberately keep their original form per the language convention's technical-identifier exception — the `VUL-IN` scaffold sentinel and a couple of marker phrases the drift tests key on stay as-is. History (`CHANGELOG.md` files, `releases/`) is left untouched. Generator, lint (0 errors), and all test suites are green.

## v1.12.0 — 2026-07-20

### #109 · Shared block for the language directive (Ravi) · Feat · 2026-07-20

Phase B left the closing "respond in the user's language" line verbatim-identical in 19 of the 20
agent defs. Ravi's duplication check recommended promoting it to a single source via the existing
`agent-shared/` mechanism — no new machinery needed, since the generator is line-based.

- **New source `agent-shared/gedrag-taalkeuze.md`** with the canonical line; the 19 identical agent
  defs now carry it between `<!-- BEGIN/END shared:gedrag-taalkeuze -->` sentinels, filled and
  verified by `build-agent-defs.ps1` like the `grens-*` blocks.
- **03-07 (Rebecca) stays local:** its line has a deliberate source-quoting nuance ("...quoting
  sources in another language is fine") — a near-duplicate that Ravi's own rule says not to force-merge.
- **Ravi's lens (06-24)** scope updated: the shared-block circle now names a third category
  (standalone behavior directives outside Boundaries/Working method) and lists `gedrag-taalkeuze`.

Naming note: the new source keeps the Dutch-style name of its `grens-*` siblings for uniformity;
renaming the whole `agent-shared/` set to English is a later-phase consistency item.

### #106 · Workshop switched to English — phase B: plugin content · Feat · 2026-07-20

Follow-up to phase A (#105): the shipped plugin content itself is now English, so consumers
worldwide read an English team. Covers all three plugins.

- **Translated:** the 20 agent definitions (prose outside the shared sentinel blocks), all 26
  manuals/playbooks, the 4 personas, `agent-shared/` (the canonical shared-bullet source), the
  three core skills + the shopify `start-task` skill, `specialists/scripts/README.md`, and the
  intro paragraphs of the three plugin `CHANGELOG.md` files (release history left as written).
- **Shared blocks regenerated:** `build-agent-defs.ps1` refilled every `<!-- BEGIN/END shared -->`
  region from the translated `agent-shared/`, so the sentinel content is English and byte-in-sync
  in all 20 agent defs.
- **Language directive aligned with the approved policy:** each agent def ended with a hard
  "work in Dutch" instruction. That contradicts the phase-A Language policy (specialists reply in
  the language the user writes in) and the worldwide-sharing goal, so all 20 now read "Respond in
  the language the user addresses you in." This is a behavior change beyond pure translation —
  flagged for review.
- **Slot-heading canon:** the human-readable `## Specific to this repo` section heading is now
  used consistently across manuals, lenses, and CLAUDE.md.

**Deliberately deferred to a later phase (scripts):** the machine-coupled Dutch marker
`## Eigen aan deze repo` still lives in `bootstrap.ps1` (the scaffold it writes),
`check-consumer-drift.ps1` (`Get-PortableBody` splits on it) and its test fixture; likewise the
`[FOUT]`/`[DRIFTED]` signal tokens, the `VUL-IN` scaffold marker, and the three Dutch PR-template
strings `open-pr.ps1` matches. Migrating those to English needs bilingual back-compat for
consumers that still carry the Dutch slot — a dedicated scripts phase. Lint and all seven test
suites pass.

## v1.7.0 — 2026-07-18

### #77 · Repo-lenzen naar het plugin-pad als standaard (primair + legacy-fallback) · Feat · 2026-07-18

De repo-lenzen van deze repo verhuizen van het legacy-pad (`.claude/extensions/`) naar het
**plugin-pad** (`.claude/plugins/claude-specialists/specialists/`) — de nieuwe standaard-locatie
(pariteit met life-hub). Om de andere consumerende repo's (life-hub, smartwatchbanden) niet te breken,
verwijst het gedeelde contract voortaan naar het **plugin-pad als primair, met het legacy-pad als
fallback** — een repo die nog op legacy staat blijft dus gewoon werken.

**Deze repo:**
- De 11 lenzen (incl. Ravi 06-24) + het handboek verplaatst naar het plugin-pad, met de relatieve
  link-diepte bijgesteld (2 → 4 niveaus). De 5 lege stubs (Paula/Bianca/Vera/Gwen/Cody) opgeruimd.
- De `@`-import onderaan `CLAUDE.md` → plugin-pad. Alle doc-verwijzingen (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`,
  het handboek) → plugin-pad. De persona-lens-index-regels naar locatie-onafhankelijke platte tekst.
- `check-plugin-integrity.ps1` scant nu de lenzen op het plugin-pad **én** het legacy-pad.

**Het gedeelde contract (raakt alle repo's, via de volgende release):**
- De ~20 agent-defs en de ~20 manuals verwijzen subagents nu naar het plugin-pad (primair) met het
  legacy-pad als fallback. De generieke lens-mention in het gedeelde `grens-inbound`-blok idem.

**Bewust uitgesteld (blijft werken via de fallback):** de **adoptie-laag** — `bootstrap.ps1` seedt
nieuwe consumenten nog op het legacy-pad, en `QUICKSTART.md` / `connectors/README.md` beschrijven dat
zo. Dat volledig omzetten (incl. de bootstrap-tests) is een aparte vervolgstap; tot die tijd landt een
verse consument op legacy en werkt hij via de fallback.

Lint en alle testsuites groen. De `## Releases`-CHANGELOG-entries zijn als historisch record ongemoeid
gelaten.

## v1.6.0 — 2026-07-18

### #74 · Gedeelde agent-def-blokken uit een enkele bron (build-en-lint) · Feat · 2026-07-18

Verbatim-gedeelde bullets onder **Grenzen** — de inbound-regel (19/19 agent-defs), de
webcontent-regel (3) en de Artifact-publiceer-regel (2) — werden tot nu toe in elke agent-def
handmatig gedupliceerd; één regel wijzigen betekende tot 19 bestanden aanraken. Ze komen nu uit
**één bron**, ingevuld door een generator en bewaakt door de lint-poort.

- **`claude-code-plugins/claude-specialists/agent-shared/<naam>.md`** — de canonieke bron van elk
  gedeeld blok (naast de plugin-mappen, zodat het niet met de plugin-cache meereist).
- **In de agent-defs** verschijnt elk blok tussen `<!-- BEGIN/END shared:<naam> -->`-sentinels. De
  inhoud staat er letterlijk (altijd-geladen, self-contained — Claude Code kent geen native
  transclusie in een agent-def), maar is als gegenereerd gemarkeerd.
- **`scripts/agents/build-agent-defs.ps1`** (+ `scripts/lib/agent-shared-lib.ps1`) — vult elke
  gemarkeerde regio uit zijn bron. Wijzig het bronbestand → draai het script → alle agent-defs bij.
  `-Check` meldt drift zonder te schrijven.
- **`check-plugin-integrity.ps1` (check 7)** faalt zodra een gemarkeerde regio afwijkt van zijn bron
  (hand-edit binnen de sentinels of een vergeten rebuild) — dezelfde poort die `open-pr.ps1` en CI
  al draaien.
- Regressietests in `scripts/tests/agent-shared.tests.ps1` (10 asserts) dekken de expansie, de
  drift-detectie, een BEGIN-zonder-END, een onbekend blok en de repo-in-sync-smoke.

De 19 agent-defs zijn puur omwikkeld met sentinels — nul inhoudelijke wijziging. Aanpassen van een
gedeelde grens kost voortaan één edit + één build in plaats van 19 handmatige wijzigingen.

## v1.5.1 — 2026-07-18

### #71 · Inbound-regel toegevoegd aan alle agent-defs · Docs · 2026-07-17

Elk van de 19 agent-defs in de drie plugins (`specialists`, `specialists-lifehub`,
`specialists-shopify`) heeft nu een eigen bullet in zijn **Grenzen**-sectie die de
inbound-route benoemt: verbeterpunten aan de gedeelde kern (de eigen agent-def en vakboek,
die van collega's, en alle andere onderdelen die de plugin draagt) bouwt een specialist
niet lokaal om; hij meldt ze via de vaste, afgesproken route — een issue met het label
`inbound` op de bron-repo van de plugin (het issue-sjabloon staat er al klaar), generiek
beschreven en zonder repo-eigen, persoonlijke of gevoelige details uit de eigen repo.
Werkt hij al in de bron-repo zelf, dan volgt hij daar gewoon de normale keten. Repo-eigen
aanvullingen horen in de repo-lens. Zo kent ook een rechtstreeks aangeroepen
werker-subagent deze regel, niet alleen Chris' persona-body en de QUICKSTART. De
formulering is na twee correctierondes (Edith's eindredactie: generieke plugin-onderdelen
+ collega's-agent-defs; Sean's security-review: standing-route-framing + de
anonimiseringscaveat) tot deze definitieve tekst gekomen.

## v1.5.0 — 2026-07-17

### #61 · Per-plugin CHANGELOGs: consument-gerichte release-geschiedenis die meereist · Feat · 2026-07-16

Elke plugin draagt nu een eigen `CHANGELOG.md` die met de plugin-cache meereist: de
consument-gerichte selectie uit de werkplaats-geschiedenis. De fold leidt per entry automatisch
een `Plugins:`-regel af uit de PR-bestanden (`gh pr view --json files`; de `connectors/`-map telt
niet mee), en `cut-release.ps1` schrijft bij elke release per plugin de rakende entries bij —
nieuwste bovenaan, met root-relatieve links herschreven naar absolute GitHub-URLs zodat ze in een
consument-cache blijven werken. Vier nieuwe pure functies in `release-lib.ps1` met twaalf nieuwe
asserts (50 totaal); drie seed-CHANGELOGs; Rendall's lens en het root-README beschrijven het
mechaniek. De root-`CHANGELOG.md` en `releases/` blijven de volledige werkplaats-geschiedenis.
