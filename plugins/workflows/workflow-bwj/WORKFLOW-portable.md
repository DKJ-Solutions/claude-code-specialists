# BWJ ticket handling -- the portable rule

**This page applies in exactly two repos: `BWJ-ecommerce/smartwatchbanden` and
`BWJ-ecommerce/xoxowildhearts`.** They are one business (BWJ) running two Shopify stores that behave
identically and differ only in brand, so they handle a discovered issue the same way. This page is
that way, written once so neither repo can drift from the other.

It is a layer on top of `contributing-davekjohn`, not a replacement for it. It extends that
workflow's **ticket-work step -- the layer before the branch** -- and changes nothing else:
branch naming, what a change owes before a PR, and what a release is are still that workflow's
answers. Read this page after
[`contributing-davekjohn`'s ticket-work section](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/claude-code-specialists/blob/main/plugins/workflows/contributing-davekjohn/CONTRIBUTING-portable.md#ticket-work--the-layer-before-the-branch),
which this one sharpens rather than repeats.

**How to read this page.** It travels with the plugin, so a link that walks out of this plugin's own
folder is written as an absolute URL -- an installed plugin is read from its own cache directory,
where the repo tree around it does not exist. Measurements and issue numbers on this page are the
**source repo's** (claude-code-specialists); they are the evidence behind a rule, never your repo's
own record.

## The rule

### 1. GitHub first -- GitHub is the source of truth

A real issue found in a BWJ store repo -- a bug, a broken customer-facing behaviour, a stale or wrong
doc, a decision that is not yours to make -- is **filed on GitHub first**, in the repo it was found
in. Full technical detail; repo and code jargon are fine, because the reader is whoever picks the
work up.

The `team-alpha` orchestrator's filing bar applies **unchanged** -- this rule adds *where the issue
is mirrored*, it does not loosen *when or whether it is filed*:

- The question to answer first is *does it still stand?*, not *may I file it?* -- read the code, the
  script or the output that would have to be true for the finding to hold, and if it collapses, say
  so instead of filing a weakened version.
- Search the tracker first, so you add to an existing thread rather than open its duplicate.
- One subject per issue.
- Say what you **measured** and what you only **inferred**.
- Filing needs no permission, and asking for it is the same failure as not filing.

### 2. Then Asana -- a translation, not a copy

Once the GitHub issue exists, mirror it to Asana in the project
`Get-AsanaProjectGid` names. The Asana task is **not** a paste of the issue body. It is written for
a BWJ colleague who does not read code and does not know the repo:

- **Plain language, outcome-framed.** What a customer or colleague actually experiences, not what the
  code does.
- **No jargon** -- no file paths, no function names, no branch names, no GitHub label vocabulary.
- **A fixed skeleton**, so every mirrored task reads the same way:

  ```text
  What is wrong:   <one or two plain sentences -- what a visitor or colleague sees>
  Where:           <which store, and which page or flow>
  How urgent:      <blocking a sale / visible but not blocking / cosmetic / not customer-facing>
  Tracked on GitHub: <issue URL>
  ```

- The task's assignee, section and due date are for the BWJ team to set in Asana. This page does not
  prescribe them.

The colleague-facing wording is Claude's to draft; a colleague may refine it in Asana afterwards
**without touching GitHub**. GitHub stays leading -- if the two ever disagree on substance, the
GitHub issue is right and the Asana task is corrected to match.

### 3. Cross-link both ways

The link is stored on both sides, and one half is machine-readable because the automation in step 4
matches on it:

- **On the GitHub issue** -- appended to the issue body:

  ```text
  Asana: <task URL>
  <!-- asana-task: <numeric task GID> -->
  ```

  The HTML-comment marker holds the bare numeric GID and nothing else. It is what the CI workflow
  reads; a task URL alone is not enough.

- **On the Asana task** -- the `Tracked on GitHub:` line of the skeleton already carries the issue
  URL. Nothing else is required there.

### 4. Close the GitHub issue -> the Asana task resolves itself

**Closing the GitHub issue is the signal.** A GitHub Actions workflow in the repo
(`.github/workflows/asana-mirror.yml`, copied from this plugin's `templates/`) does the rest:

| GitHub event | what happens in Asana |
|---|---|
| issue **closed** | the linked task is marked complete, with a comment `Resolved via GitHub <repo>#<n>` |
| issue **reopened** | the linked task is set back to incomplete |
| daily schedule | a reconciliation sweep completes any task whose linked issue is closed but which a missed event left open |

No one resolves the Asana task by hand. If a task has no `<!-- asana-task: ... -->` marker on its
issue, the workflow logs it and moves on -- it never guesses.

### 5. What still needs a person

- **Setup, once per repo:** the repo secret `ASANA_PAT` and the variables `ASANA_WORKSPACE_GID` /
  `ASANA_PROJECT_GID`, plus copying the two `templates/` files into `.github/`. The
  [`adopt-bwj-asana`](skills/adopt-bwj-asana/SKILL.md) skill walks this.
- **The Asana project answer:** whether both stores mirror into one shared project or one project
  each is a BWJ decision. `Get-AsanaProjectGid` returns whatever each repo sets, so either works --
  but the two repos must make the *same* kind of choice, or this page's promise of "identical" is
  broken.

---

## Why it is shaped this way

- **GitHub first, not Asana first**, because the people who fix the issue live in GitHub and the
  fix's lifecycle (branch, PR, merge, release) is already tracked there by `contributing-davekjohn`.
  Asana is the window the rest of BWJ looks through, not the workbench.
- **A translation, not a copy**, because a mirrored task that is just the issue body helps nobody: a
  non-technical colleague cannot act on a stack trace, and a technical reader already has the issue.
- **CI, not a session**, for the resolve step, because it must happen every time an issue closes
  whether or not anyone is running Claude, and because a workflow file is version-controlled and
  reviewable where an Asana-side automation rule is not.
- **A reconciliation sweep**, because a single webhook can be missed and a task stuck open in Asana
  is exactly the drift this plugin exists to prevent.
