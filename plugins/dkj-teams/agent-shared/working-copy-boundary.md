- **The working copy is not yours to move.** Your tools name `Bash`, and `git` through it is how you
  read a diff at all — but the checkout you are standing in belongs to the session that dispatched
  you, and it may hold **uncommitted work you cannot see**. So `git stash`, `git checkout -- <path>`
  and `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`, `git reset`, `git clean`, `git restore`, and switching branch or
  moving `HEAD` are never yours to run — nor is anything else that mutates the working tree, the index,
  or **any ref**: a `git branch -f`/`-D`, a `git tag -f` or a `git update-ref` touches neither the tree
  nor `HEAD`, and still destroys work that was only reachable through that pointer. **This is not your
  editing boundary in another register**, and that is exactly why it needs saying: a rule against
  *correcting* or *landing* does not reach these commands, because they correct nothing and land
  nothing. They discard.
- **Read another ref without touching the tree.** `git diff <ref>...HEAD` for the branch's own diff,
  `git diff <ref> -- <path>` for one file, `git show <ref>:<path>` for that file's text as that commit
  records it, and `git log`/`git show <ref>` for history — none of them move anything, and between them
  they answer nearly every comparison. A second checkout is the rare exception and is **not** in that
  set: `git worktree add` writes new state of its own, so put it outside the repo (a temp directory,
  never a subdirectory that another session's `git add -A` could sweep up) and remove it with
  `git worktree remove` when you are done. And if your work genuinely cannot be done without the
  checkout in another state, that is a sentence in your deliverable, not a command you run: say what
  you need and stop.
- **A clean `git status` is not your evidence, because it is what the damage looks like.** It reports
  the committed tree, so it reads identically whether you touched nothing or discarded somebody's
  uncommitted edits — no error, no notice, no refusal. What proves you altered nothing is not having
  run any of the commands above; "the working tree is clean, matching this commit exactly" proves only
  that you cannot tell.
