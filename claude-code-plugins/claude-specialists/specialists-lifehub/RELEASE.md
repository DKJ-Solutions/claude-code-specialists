### #261 · The seam migration left stale lens paths in the prose · Docs · 2026-07-30

The seam shipped its **machinery** in v2.15.0 ([#253](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/253)
specified it, [#254](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/254) taught the bootstrap
and the teardown to write and remove it, [#255](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/255)
migrated this repo onto it). Its **prose** did not come along. Measured today: **120 occurrences of the
pre-seam lens path across 57 files**, in all four plugins — every agent def, every manual, `QUICKSTART.md`,
the family README, the connectors README, and the shared `agent-shared/inbound-behaviour.md` block that
is filled verbatim into 19 agent defs.

That is not cosmetic. Those texts are the instruction a specialist reads *while working in a consuming
repo*: "repo-specific additions belong in the repo lens
(`.claude/plugins/claude-specialists/<plugin>/<group>-<id>-extension.md`)". A specialist who follows it
writes a file the seam does not hold and `check-roster-sync` reports as off-path.

**Why no gate caught it.** Two independent reasons, and both are worth keeping:

1. **The paths appear in prose and in code spans, not as links.** The dead-link scan resolves link
   *targets*; it never reads a label or a backticked path. So a document may describe a layout that no
   longer exists and stay green.
2. **In this repo's own `.claude/specialists/`, the labels were wrong while the targets were right.**
   `README.md` was still titled `# .claude/plugins/claude-specialists`, its layout section still
   described `plugins/claude-specialists/specialists/`, and its whole index table used
   `specialists/<id>-extension.md` labels over `lenses/<id>-extension.md` targets. Every link resolved.
   Exactly the class [#260](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/pull/260) named a day
   earlier: the description and the thing described drift apart, and nothing announces it.

**History is left alone.** The per-plugin `CHANGELOG.md` files and the archived release notes keep the
pre-seam path — they record what was true then, and this repo does not rewrite history (the same
reasoning that lets those notes keep their original language). Two analytical mentions are also kept
deliberately, because the old path is their *subject* rather than their instruction: the teardown-gap
bullet in the family README (now marked settled) and the #227 lesson in
[Sylvester's lens](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/blob/main/.claude/specialists/lenses/05-15-extension.md), where the citation now says which
path the bootstrap wrote at the time.

**Two things found while chasing the prose, both bigger than a path:**

- **`sync-roster` still writes to the pre-seam path** — a real defect, not a wording slip, and split off
  to its own `fix/` branch rather than buried here. Its `SKILL.md` line is therefore the one stale path
  left in this diff: the doc follows the behaviour, not the other way round.
- **`specialists-init`'s SKILL.md still carried the claim [#215](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/issues/215)
  disproved** — *"what a plugin cannot do is inject always-on main-loop context"*. The family README has
  carried the correction since July 29; the skill a consumer actually reads did not. Corrected with a
  pointer to both, and stating that the switch is deliberately off — the wording was wrong regardless of
  whether Dave ever flips it.

Also reworded: "on the plugin path" as a *description of the seam*, in `QUICKSTART.md` (3),
`specialists-init/SKILL.md` (3) and the connectors README (1). The seam is not the plugin path — that
was the point of moving it, so calling it that undoes the sentence.

**One regression the sweep would have introduced, caught on the copy-edit pass.** Every agent def and
manual tells its specialist where the repo lens lives, with a fallback: *"or the legacy path
`.claude/extensions/…`"*. Before the sweep that sentence named the **pre-seam plugin path** as the
primary and the pre-plugin-path one as the fallback; a naive replacement left it naming the seam and the
oldest path while dropping the middle one — which is exactly where the two un-migrated consumers
(`life-hub`, `smartwatchbanden`) keep their lenses today. A specialist reading only the new sentence
would look in two places and miss the one holding the file. `Get-LensDirCandidates` reads all three
regardless, so no check would have failed. The parenthetical now names both fallbacks in one shape across
all 27 files: *"or, if this repo has not migrated to the seam, at its pre-seam
`.claude/plugins/<family>/<plugin>/` or `.claude/extensions/` location"*. **A mechanical replacement
inherits the old sentence's assumptions — read what the sentence claimed, not just the token you
changed.**

**Found and deliberately left alone:** `check-consumer-drift` reports `03-02-extension.md` (Bianca) as
`[DRIFTED]` — her lens carries a body copy instead of following the lens-only model. Informational, it
does not affect the exit code, and it predates this branch: she was adopted onto the roster on July 28,
2026. Recorded here so it is on the record rather than in a session.
