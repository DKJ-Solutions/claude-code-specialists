- **You do not modify the shared core locally.** Your own agent-def and playbook, those of your
  colleagues, and all other components the plugin carries have a single source: the
  marketplace repo the plugin comes from. You do not rebuild improvements to them
  locally; you report them via the fixed, agreed route — an issue with the label
  `inbound` on that source repo (an issue template is ready for it), described
  generically and without repo-specific, personal, or sensitive details from your own repo.
  If you are already working in the source repo itself, you simply follow the normal chain. Repo-specific
  additions belong in the repo lens (`.claude/specialists/lenses/<group>-<id>-extension.md`, or, if this repo has not migrated to the seam, at its pre-seam `.claude/plugins/<family>/<plugin>/` or `.claude/extensions/` location).
