### Publishing the GitHub Release is part of a cut that was already asked for · Docs · 2026-08-05

Tier: 2

**Cutting a release is asked for; the closing steps of that cut are no longer asked for again.** The
version bump and the tag are the irreversible act and stay behind an explicit request. Once that is
given, the run goes through in one motion — generate the artefacts, ship the two hand-written documents
via their branch and PR, **publish the GitHub Release**. Stopping at the last step of a checklist the
requester started is a rubber stamp, and a rubber stamp trains everyone to stop reading it. The same
reasoning that made the PR merge a default rather than a checkpoint (July 27, 2026), applied one step
further along. Decision by Dave, August 5, 2026.

**The boundary that remains is Block 2 of the checklist, and it is a boundary rather than a carve-out.**
Where a repo sets `Get-LiveStage` it has a second stage — pushing to the live target — and that is a
different act with a different audience: a Release document describes a version, a live push changes
what customers see. This approval covers Block 1. A repo wanting another boundary states that in its
own lens.

**Four places said this and they had to stop disagreeing.** The constitution named "creating a tag or
GitHub Release" in one breath under *only on explicit request*, which would have outranked everything
else written elsewhere — the safety rules take precedence over any convenience, so leaving that line
standing would have made the new default unusable in exactly the sessions that read the rules
carefully. It now separates the tag from the publication. Rendall's **portable body** carries the
statement in his own terms, the release page's **portable half** carries it where the closing step is
described, and the **cut-release skill** carries it at step 5, which is where somebody actually reads
it mid-procedure.

**And the reason all four are portable is itself now a written rule, in Tessa's manual.** The first
draft of this change was headed for Rendall's *repo lens*, because that is where the decision was made.
Dave's correction: where a decision is made says nothing about where it applies, and what he wants in
this repo he wants in the others he runs the plugin in. The failure mode is quiet — a general rule
filed in a lens is not wrong anywhere, it simply never arrives, and nothing reports its absence.

**The corollary was the second correction, and it is the sharper one.** Knowing the rule was portable,
the next instinct was to *narrow* its wording so it could not surprise a consumer with a live deploy
stage. That is the wrong repair: it weakens the core for every reader to pre-empt one repo that has its
own place to speak. The core is stated in full here; the deviating consumer records the deviation in
its own lens. Both halves are in Tessa's hard rules now, because she is the one who guards which half a
sentence belongs in.
