### the release card states what it describes, not where you are · Fix · 2026-08-02

Every plugin's `RELEASE.md` card carried the line *"You are on this release."* — written at cut time,
about a reader the card has never met. Round v13 measured it false in the ordinary case (inbound
[#384](https://github.com/DaveKJohn/davekjohns-workshop/issues/384)): the payload came from `main`,
three commits past the tag whose number both the card and `plugin.json` were carrying.

What makes it more than cosmetic is *where* the reader meets it. The QUICKSTART already documents
that **the documented update path cannot deliver a tagged release**, because the source it reads is a
branch — and v13 was the first round in which a consumer ran that tag comparison and reached the right
conclusion: *I am on `main`, not on the release*. Two minutes later the card of that same release told
them the opposite. Two documents of one family contradicting each other about one measurement, with
the wrong one being the one that cannot know.

`Build-PluginReleaseCard` now writes what the card *can* know — the version its manifest carries — and
hands the "where am I" question to the check that can answer it, linked as an absolute URL because the
card is read from a plugin cache where the QUICKSTART does not ship. The fix is in the generator, so
it holds for every future release instead of being retyped; the four cards on disk were regenerated to
match, and `cut-release.ps1`'s own description, [Rendall #06's lens](.claude/specialists/lenses/05-06-extension.md)
and the QUICKSTART line pointing at the card all follow the behaviour.

The test that pinned the old sentence now pins the new one **plus its negative**: the card must not
claim the reader is on this release. A line this one is only a repair for as long as nothing puts it
back.
