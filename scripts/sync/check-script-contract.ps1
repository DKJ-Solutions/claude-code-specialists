.SYNOPSIS
    Script-contract check: detects when a consumer's repo-owned workflow libs (scripts/lib/branch-
    info.ps1, scripts/repo-config.ps1) lag behind the function contract that the shared, mirrored
    workflow scripts (issue #81) actually call at runtime (LAYER 1 -- detection only, no fixes).

.DESCRIPTION
    The shared workflow scripts are centralized in the plugin, but dot-source REPO-OWNED libs from
    the consumer: scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1 and scripts/repo-config.ps1. After a plugin update
    these libs can lag the contract the shared scripts expect -- the real incident this check exists
    for (issue #147): after updating the plugin, the first `new-branch` run crashed with
    "The term 'Test-BranchName' is not recognized" because the consumer's branch-info.ps1 predated
    that helper. There was a roster-drift guard (check-roster-sync + roster-sessioncheck) but no
    equivalent guard for the repo-owned SCRIPT CONTRACT. This mirrors that architecture exactly.

    The declared contract (mandatory repo-owned functions per mirrored, consumer-run shared script):
      - new-changelog-entry -> branch-info.ps1: Get-BranchInfo
      - new-branch          -> branch-info.ps1: Test-BranchName
      - open-pr             -> branch-info.ps1: Get-BranchInfo
                               repo-config.ps1: Get-RepoName, Get-LintScript
      - fold-changelog-entry -> repo-config.ps1: Get-RepoName
                                repo-config.ps1: Get-ChangelogHeading (OPTIONAL -- see below)
      - check-roster-sync   -> repo-config.ps1: Get-RosterPath, Get-RosterIgnoredIds
      - cut-release skill   -> repo-config.ps1: Get-LiveStage (OPTIONAL -- see below)

    OPTIONAL contract entries are declared with Optional = $true and report [INFO] instead of
    [ERROR] when absent, naming the default that will be used. Get-ChangelogHeading (issue #178) is
    the case this exists for: fold-changelog-entry.ps1 falls back to '## Pull Requests', so a
    consumer without the function is not broken -- but a consumer whose CHANGELOG names its section
    differently DOES need it, and silence would leave them to discover that at fold time.
    Get-LiveStage (issue #177) is the same pattern for the cut-release skill: it falls back to an
    empty string (no separate live stage, Block 2 of the checklist never applies), so a consumer
    without the function is not broken either -- but a repo that DOES have a live stage needs it
    filled in, or the skill would silently never print that block.

    Deliberately OUT of the contract entirely: the optional repo-config functions that open-pr.ps1
    guards via Get-Command (Get-PrDescriptionPlaceholder, Get-PrApprovalPattern, Get-PrAssignee,
    Get-PrMilestone) -- those are per-repo taste with no wrong-by-default failure mode, so they are
    never declared here.
    Also out of scope: workshop-only scripts (ship-pr.ps1, scripts/release/cut-release.ps1 -- the
    284-line, marketplace-specific script that bumps every plugin.json in lockstep) -- they are not
    mirrored into the plugin and are not part of the consumer contract. The 'cut-release' entry above
    is a different thing entirely: the shared cut-release SKILL (issue #177), a checklist with no
    script of its own, that reads Get-LiveStage to decide whether its Block 2 applies.

    For each repo-owned lib in the contract:
      - lib file MISSING            -> [ERROR] naming the file and every function/shared-script that
                                        depends on it (nothing to dot-source, so nothing more to check
                                        for that lib).
      - lib present but dot-sourcing it THROWS -> [ERROR] naming the lib and the error (e.g. a syntax
                                        error), rather than letting this script crash.
      - lib present, a required function MISSING -> [ERROR] naming the function, the lib it must
                                        live in, and which shared script(s) call it -- the same
                                        information the runtime crash would have surfaced, but before
                                        it happens.
      - lib present, function present -> [OK] (detail visible on a deliberate run, like
                                        check-roster-sync.ps1).

    A repo-config.ps1 that still contains VUL-IN placeholders (an unfilled specialists-init scaffold)
    is not, by itself, a contract violation here -- Get-RepoName/Get-LintScript etc. still exist as
    functions (they just return placeholder text), so open-pr.ps1's own VUL-IN pre-flight catches
    that case. This check's job is narrower and stays that way: function PRESENCE, not content.

    Soft/read-only, mirroring check-roster-sync.ps1: this script changes nothing, in any repo.
    [OK]/[INFO]/[ERROR] convention shared via check-report-lib.ps1 (issue #114).

    StrictMode note: this script itself runs under Set-StrictMode -Version Latest, but each
    consumer lib (branch-info.ps1 / repo-config.ps1) is dot-sourced and probed in a child scope with
    StrictMode explicitly OFF. The real runtime callers this check models (open-pr.ps1,
    new-branch.ps1, new-changelog-entry.ps1, fold-changelog-entry.ps1) never call Set-StrictMode, and
    both consumer libs are deliberately written on that no-strict-mode assumption (harmless loose
    top-level code is expected there). Do NOT "helpfully" move the dot-source into strict scope --
    that produces false [ERROR]s for legacy-but-working consumer libs that never crash at real
    runtime (see issue tracker: reported by code review).

    Exit code: 0 = no errors, 1 = at least one error.
