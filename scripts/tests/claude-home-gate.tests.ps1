.SYNOPSIS
    Regression tests for the fixture-pollution check (issue #1609): the check script
    scripts/lint/check-claude-home.ps1, the SessionStart hook claude-home-sessioncheck.ps1, and the
    AllRecords field the check reads from Get-InstallRecord.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dependency-free: no Pester needed, only PowerShell.

        powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/tests/claude-home-gate.tests.ps1

    NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE REAL ~/.claude, AND THAT IS NOT A COURTESY -- it is the defect under test.
    #1609 is a debug script that wrote fixture data into the real user tree because it never redirected
    the home; a suite for that check which read or wrote the real administration would be the same
    mistake, committed, running on every push and on every consumer's gate. So every case passes
    -HomeOverride into a fixture tree, and the two cases that assert on the SNAPSHOT are the only ones
    that let the check write at all -- every other case passes -NoSnapshot.

    -ScratchRootOverride IS PASSED EVERYWHERE, for a reason particular to this check. The fixture trees
    live under %TEMP%, which is exactly what the check calls scratch -- so without the override every
    record a fixture writes reads as polluted and the CLEAN case cannot be expressed at all. The
    override names a tree that does not exist, which is what makes a fixture path ordinary again. The
    machine's own resolution is therefore NOT exercised here, and that is a named test gap rather than
    an oversight: it reads $env:TEMP and a '\temp\' path segment, and a suite that asserted on them
    would be asserting about the machine it happens to run on. What IS pinned is the boundary logic
    those roots feed -- the prefix test below walks a sibling directory whose name merely begins the
    same way.

    Fixture paths carry $PID (repo convention): the test gate is a throttled parallel scheduler, so two
    runs overlapping is ordinary and two sharing one fixed temp path tear down each other's tree.

    Pure ASCII (repo convention for .ps1).
