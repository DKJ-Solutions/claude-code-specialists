.SYNOPSIS
    Shared helper to run a native command safely and capture its output + exit code (single source
    of truth, issue #114 item 1).

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source this file from a sibling of the script that needs it, relative to $PSScriptRoot (NOT
    $repoRoot) -- like scripts/lib/check-report-lib.ps1 and unlike scripts/repo-config.ps1 /
    scripts/lib/branch-info.ps1, this lib is not repo-owned, so it does not need a consumer-side
    scaffold. It travels as part of the SAME plugin/mirror payload as its callers (registered in
    scripts/lib/shared-scripts-lib.ps1), so a $PSScriptRoot-relative path resolves correctly whether
    the caller runs from the workshop root, a consumer's plugin cache, or the plugin mirror tree:

        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot '..\lib\native-capture-lib.ps1')   -- from scripts/release/*

    Why this exists (the #96/#97/#107 lesson, in one place):
      Windows PowerShell 5.1 promotes a native command's stderr lines to a TERMINATING
      NativeCommandError when $ErrorActionPreference is 'Stop'. A command that writes progress to
      stderr -- git push's 'remote:' lines, gh's status/URL lines -- would then kill the script
      BEFORE its $LASTEXITCODE could be judged, even when the command itself returned exit 0. The
      lesson: never rely on stderr-as-error, always on $LASTEXITCODE. This helper centralizes the
      save-EAP -> Continue -> run -> record $LASTEXITCODE -> restore dance so that reasoning lives
      in exactly one tested place instead of being re-derived at every call site.

    The native command runs INSIDE this function's own scope, where EAP is set to 'Continue'. That
    is deliberate: a scriptblock passed in by the caller would keep the caller's script scope (where
    EAP is usually 'Stop') as its resolution scope, so an EAP override here would not reach it --
    passing FilePath/Arguments and invoking here is what makes the guard actually take effect.

    Usage:
        $r = Invoke-NativeCapture -FilePath 'git' -Arguments @('push', '-u', 'origin', $branch)
        $r.Output | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_ }
        if ($r.ExitCode -ne 0) { Write-Error 'git push failed.'; exit 1 }

        # -DiscardStderr keeps stderr out of the captured output (e.g. so it cannot pollute JSON):
        $r = Invoke-NativeCapture -FilePath 'gh' -Arguments @('pr', 'list', '--json', 'number') -DiscardStderr

    No Set-StrictMode here: dot-sourcing would change the strict mode of the calling script.
    Pure ASCII (repo convention for .ps1).

function Invoke-NativeCapture {
    <#
        Run $FilePath with $Arguments under $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue' and return a
        pscustomobject with:
          - Output   : the command's output. By default stderr is merged in (2>&1) so a caller can
                       echo full progress; with -DiscardStderr stderr is dropped (2>$null) so it
                       cannot pollute a machine-readable stdout (e.g. gh --json).
          - ExitCode : $LASTEXITCODE recorded immediately after the command ran.
        EAP is always restored (finally), whether the command succeeds, fails, or throws.

    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)][string]$FilePath,
        [string[]]$Arguments = @(),
        [switch]$DiscardStderr
    )

    $prevEap = $ErrorActionPreference
    try {
        $ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'
        if ($DiscardStderr) {
            $output = & $FilePath @Arguments 2>$null
        } else {
            $output = & $FilePath @Arguments 2>&1
        }
        $code = $LASTEXITCODE
    } finally {
        $ErrorActionPreference = $prevEap
    }

    return [pscustomobject]@{ Output = $output; ExitCode = $code }
}

function Invoke-TestSuiteGate {
    <#
        Runs every *.tests.ps1 in $TestsDir as a child process and returns $true when they all passed.
        Prints each suite's name and its own output as it goes, so a failure is attributable without a
        second run.

        ONE OWNER, BECAUSE THERE ARE NOW TWO GATES (August 7, 2026). open-pr.ps1 has run the suites
        before pushing since PR #54's lesson; cut-release.ps1 ran the LINT only, which made the release
        commit the least-checked commit in the workflow -- the one that bumps four plugin versions,
        rewrites four RELEASE.md cards and empties CHANGELOG.md. Issue #510.

        The obvious repair was to copy those fifteen lines into the cut. That is the duplication this
        repo spent August 7 removing in six other places: two copies of one rule, free to drift, with the
        one that drifts being whichever nobody looked at. So the loop moved here and both call it.

        WHY THIS LIB AND NOT A NEW ONE, stated because the fit is imperfect. This file's synopsis is "run
        a native command safely and capture its output + exit code", and a test-suite gate is a step above
        that. A dedicated gate-lib.ps1 would read better -- and would cost an entry in the shared-scripts
        registry, a mirror file, and a row in the script contract, for one function. Both callers already
        dot-source this lib, and what the function does IS running child processes and judging their exit
        codes. The trade was taken deliberately; if a second gate helper ever appears, move both out
        together rather than widening this file again.

        NOT -SkipTests AWARE. The caller owns the escape valve, because the two differ: open-pr's is
        -SkipTests, the cut's is its own flag, and a lib that knew about either would be reaching into its
        callers' parameter sets.

        Returns $true when every suite exited 0, $false when any did not, and $true with a warning when
        there is nothing to run -- an empty or missing directory is a repo without suites, not a failure.
