.SYNOPSIS
    The changelog entry's own format, in one place: the scaffold strings new-changelog-entry.ps1
    WRITES and open-pr.ps1 REFUSES TO SHIP, the entry's heading levels and named sections, the impact
    table declaring how far a change reaches and what it weighs at each reach, and the ranked offset the
    fold inserts it at.

.DESCRIPTION
    Dot-source it:

        . (Join-Path $PSScriptRoot '..\lib\entry-scaffold-lib.ps1')

    WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, given it holds three strings. Those three had to be known by two
    scripts that must never disagree about them: one writes the scaffold, the other blocks a PR whose
    entry still carries it. A copy in each would make the gate silently miss whatever the writer
    changed -- a drift guard that drifts, which is worse than no guard because it reports success. So
    the wording became a single source the moment the second reader appeared, exactly as CLAUDE.md
    requires for a rule living in two places.

    THE IMPACT DECLARATION JOINED IT FOR THE SAME REASON, WITH ONE MORE READER (the tier model, August 5,
    2026). How far a change reaches is written by new-changelog-entry.ps1, validated by open-pr.ps1 before a
    PR can ship, read by fold-changelog-entry.ps1 to decide where in CHANGELOG.md the entry lands, and read
    again by the release cut to decide which documents it appears in. Four scripts, one format: a copy in
    each is how a fold starts filing tier-2 work as repo-internal without anything erroring.

    THE DECLARATION IS NOW A TABLE, AND THE OLDER 'Tier: N' LINE IS STILL RECOGNISED -- this repo's standing
    "recognise both, write one" rule, because every entry already merged and every entry in a consumer's tree
    predates the table.

    REPO-OWNED, WITH BUILT-IN DEFAULTS (#410). Each string comes from an OPTIONAL function in the
    consumer's scripts/repo-config.ps1 -- Get-EntryTitlePlaceholder, Get-EntryBodyHeading,
    Get-EntryBodyPlaceholder -- probed with Get-Command and falling back to the English value
    new-changelog-entry.ps1 used to hardcode. A consumer that defines none of them is unaffected.
    (Get-EntryFallbackType is deliberately NOT here: it is a changelog TYPE, not scaffold prose --
    'Chore' is a legitimate final value, so it can never be evidence of an unedited entry.)

    Pure ASCII (repo convention for .ps1).
#>

# The English fallbacks, and the ONLY copy of them. new-changelog-entry.ps1 held these literals until
# the gate needed the same list; it now reads them from here.
$script:EntryScaffoldDefaults = [ordered]@{
    Title         = 'TODO: title'
    BodyHeading   = '**To do / where I left off:**'
    BodyPlaceholder = 'TODO: what still needs to happen on this branch, and where you left off.'
}

function Get-EntryScaffoldWording {
    <#
        Returns the scaffold wording as an object with Title, BodyHeading and BodyPlaceholder --
        this repo's answers where repo-config.ps1 gives them, the English defaults otherwise.

        The caller is expected to have dot-sourced repo-config.ps1 already (both callers do, for other
        reasons); this function only PROBES, it does not load it. That keeps it usable from a test that
        wants the bare defaults, by simply not defining the getters.

        An override that is present but EMPTY is ignored rather than honoured. A getter returning ''
        would otherwise blank a marker, and a blank marker matches every entry ever written -- so the
        gate would refuse every PR in the repo, which is the worst possible failure for a guard whose
        whole job is to be trusted.

        }

}

function Get-FencedLineFlags {
    <#
        Returns a bool per input line: is that line inside a fenced code block? The fence MARKER itself is
        reported as fenced ($true), so a caller that skips fenced lines keeps the markers with their content
        rather than stripping them and leaving the body inside rendered as prose.

        THE ONE FENCE READER OF THIS FORMAT, and it lives here because this is the lower lib. Every markdown
        structure test in the entry format has to ask this question -- '^## ' for an entry boundary, '^---$'
        for a separator, 'Tier:' for a declaration, the impact table's header row, the three section
        headings -- and every one of them must NOT fire on text an entry body QUOTES. An entry may
        legitimately show a broken heading structure, a YAML frontmatter example, or the very format it
        introduces, and treating that as structure is the defect class this system has now paid for at
        least five times:

          * cutting v2.13.3 produced a third entry from two PRs, split a fence open, and duplicated a
            category heading in the release notes;
          * the fold would have deleted a 'Tier: 0' line out of the fence that was explaining it;
          * a quoted impact table would have disabled the reader that met it first;
          * and on the fold of PR #478 a quoted entry heading split a real entry in two, so the fragment
            above its impact table read as tier 0 and a tier-1 entry was inserted at the top of a list
            whose next six entries were tier 2.

        SO THERE IS ONE ANSWER AND ONE PLACE THAT GIVES IT. Until this change there were two named
        functions with this job -- this one and Get-FencedLineFlags in release-lib.ps1 -- plus two inline
        walks in this file. Four walks, and they were NOT equivalent: the release-lib one recognised '~~~'
        fences and the three here did not, so an entry using tilde fences had its quoted content read as
        structure by every reader in this file while release-lib's readers handled it correctly. That
        difference is exactly what "two answers that can drift" means, found by comparing them rather than
        by anything failing. The union rule wins, so the tilde form is now honoured everywhere.

        Deliberately simple: a line whose first non-space characters are ``` or ~~~ toggles the state.
        That is CommonMark's own rule for the common cases and needs no parser. Nested fences of the same
        kind are not a thing in CommonMark, and an unclosed fence leaves the tail flagged as fenced --
        which is the safe direction for every caller here, since it can only cause a missed finding, never
        a false accusation against text somebody did write.

        The name is deliberately NOT entry-specific: release-lib's readers scan a whole CHANGELOG rather
        than one entry, and they call this by exactly this name -- so moving the owner down a layer changed
        no call site in either lib.

          Fenced  one bool per CONTENT line, in order, from Get-FencedLineFlags

        WHY THIS EXISTS: the two removers below (Remove-EntryTierLine, Remove-EntryImpactTable) each used
        to walk the fences themselves while deciding what to drop. That is where two of this file's four
        fence walks lived, and it is why neither recognised '~~~'. They need the flags AND the separators,
        which is an awkward pair to derive twice -- so it is derived once, here, and both read it.

        The separators are preserved rather than normalised because the caller has already matched its
        document's own style; rewriting them would put CRLF and LF in one entry.

        Pure: the entry's text with every fenced code block removed, for a caller that wants to match
        STRUCTURE rather than a mention of it.

        ITS OWN FUNCTION BECAUSE TWO READERS NEEDED THE SAME STRIPPING. The scaffold gate needs it
        because an entry may legitimately quote the scaffold while documenting this very mechanism --
        this repo's own docs do -- and the tier reader needs it for exactly the same reason, one
        mechanism later. This repo has measured the cost of the alternative four times in one day: a
        matcher satisfied by a MENTION rather than a use.

        Deliberately simple: pair up ``` runs and drop what is between them. An unclosed fence
        swallows the tail, which is the safe direction for both callers -- it can only cause a missed
        finding, never a false accusation against text somebody did write.

# --- The tier line -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 'Tier: N' declares how far an entry reaches. It was superseded by the impact table below on the day it
# shipped and is kept because every entry written before that carries it; it is also the FIRST key the fold
# orders CHANGELOG.md's flat list on, since August 5, 2026. The ladder (Dave, August 5, 2026):
#
#   Tier 0 -- nobody outside this repo's own developers notices. Docs, config, repo-internal work.
#   Tier 1 -- a colleague working on this project gets something out of it.
#   Tier 2 -- a consumer of the product notices it.
#
# CUMULATIVE, NOT THREE BOXES: tier 2 implies tier 1, so a tier-2 entry appears in both the internal
# note and the highlights. That is what keeps 'tier' one axis of impact instead of three categories
# somebody has to choose between.
#
# THE LABEL IS NOT REPO-OWNED, unlike the four scaffold strings above, and that is deliberate rather
# than an omission. 'Tier:' is a machine-read metadata key -- the same class as the 'Plugins:' line
# the fold writes, and the same class the language rule calls a technical identifier that keeps its
# original form. The three scripts that read it must agree on the literal; a translated key would
# make an entry unreadable to the fold in the repo that translated it.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS THE HARMLESS END, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT. An entry with no tier line
# is tier 0, so forgetting to classify cannot promote work into a consumer-facing document. It has a
# cost -- a release cannot be cut out of tier-0 work alone -- but that cost is LOUD: the cut refuses
# and names the entries. The reverse default would be silent, and would be wrong in the one direction
# that reaches people outside this repo.

    <#
        Pure: the closing line the FOLD appends to an entry -- the two facts that do not exist until the
        merge. '[PR #468](https://...) <middot> merged 2026-08-05'.

        $MergedAt is the PR's own merge timestamp as gh returns it (ISO 8601, UTC). Empty or unparseable
        -> $FallbackDate is used, which the caller reads off its clock.

        WHY THE PR'S TIMESTAMP AND NOT THE CLOCK (Dave, August 5, 2026). The date used to be scaffolded
        into the entry's HEADING when the branch was created, making it the branch's birth date rather
        than the landing date -- wrong by however many days the branch lived, in the one document whose
        subject is when things landed. Moving it to the fold fixes that; reading it off the PR fixes the
        remainder, because the fold does not always run seconds after the merge. This repo has measured
        that gap: unfolded entry files were once found in the repo root the morning after their merge. A
        clock reading would have dated those a day late, and nothing in the output would have said so.

        WHY A FUNCTION RATHER THAN THREE LINES IN THE FOLD. The fold drives a live remote, so its own
        suite deliberately does not depend on a PR existing -- which would have left the one path this
        change adds untested. Same move, same reason as Get-ExistingPrRecord in pr-issues-lib.ps1: the
        part that is a pure function of an API answer becomes one, so it can be asserted without the API.

function Resolve-EntryTier {

        Pure: reads the tier an entry declares. Returns an object with

          Tier      the tier as an int -- the default (0) when nothing is declared OR when what is
                    declared cannot be honoured, so a caller that ignores Error still fails safe
                    towards the harmless end rather than crashing.
          Declared  $true when a 'Tier:' line was found outside fenced code.
          Raw       exactly what stood after the colon, for quoting back at the author.
          Error     $null when all is well; otherwise the reason, ready to print.

        AN OBJECT RATHER THAN AN INT, and the reason is the failure this has to make impossible. A
        'Tier: 5' or a 'Tier: two' that silently read back as 0 would file the change as repo-internal
        -- correct-looking output, wrong document, and nothing to notice. So the malformed case is
        reported instead of absorbed, and open-pr.ps1 refuses the PR over it while the branch is still
        the only thing affected.

        FENCE-AWARE, and the FIRST match outside a fence wins. An entry documenting the tier model
        writes 'Tier: 2' inside a fence -- this file's own repo does it in the docs shipped with this
        change -- and a parser that cannot tell a quote from a declaration gets disabled by whoever
        hits it first.

function Remove-EntryTierLine {
    <#
        Removes the 'Tier:' line (and the blank line it leaves behind) from an entry block.

        ITS CALLER MOVED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE STORY OF THIS FUNCTION (August 5, 2026). It was written for
        the FOLD: once an entry sat under '## Tier 2 - Pull Requests', the section stated the tier, so a line
        inside the entry restating it was the same fact in two places -- the drift shape this repo has paid
        for three times. The sections are gone, so there is nothing above a folded entry stating its reach,
        and the fold now KEEPS the line: consuming it would leave the entry declaring nothing, and every
        downstream reader would take that as tier 0.

        What did not change is that the line must never travel OUTWARD. A self-assigned tier printed at a
        consumer is the same class of thing as a self-assigned score, and the line now reaches CHANGELOG.md
        where it never used to -- so this belongs on the same stripping path as Remove-EntryImpactTable, in
        the renderers that build the highlights, the per-plugin CHANGELOGs and the release cards. That wiring
        is the release side's to make; this function is unchanged and waiting for it.

        Same shape as Remove-EntryPluginsLine in release-lib.ps1, deliberately: both strip one
        bookkeeping line and collapse the double blank it leaves. It lives HERE rather than there
        because the fold reaches release-lib only when the repo happens to have it (see that
        dot-source's guard), while this lib travels with the fold itself.

        FENCE-AWARE, AND ONLY THE FIRST DECLARATION IS REMOVED -- which is not symmetry with the reader
        for its own sake but the case that arrived immediately. The changelog entry for the change that
        introduced this model quotes 'Tier: 0' inside a fence to explain the format; a blind regex would
        have deleted that line out of the fence while folding, silently damaging the one entry that
        documents the mechanism. Removing exactly what Resolve-EntryTier READ is the only behaviour
        that cannot surprise: what the fold consumed is what the fold acted on.

        The line ending is preserved rather than normalised: the caller has already matched the
        changelog's own style, and rewriting it here would put CRLF and LF in one entry.

# --- The impact table: how far a change reaches, and how much it weighs at each reach --------------
#
# ONE TABLE INSTEAD OF THREE METADATA LINES (Dave, August 5, 2026; issue #467). An entry declares its
# impact as a markdown table with THE TIER AS THE ROW and the significance as a column:
#
#     | Tier | Significance | Why |
#     |---|---|---|
#     | 2 | 5 | consumers must re-add the marketplace under its new name; installs break without it |
#     | 1 | 4 | the routine version bump stops needing a developer |
#
# WHAT THE SHAPE BUYS, beyond reading better than three colon-separated keys. The tier ladder is
# CUMULATIVE -- tier 2 implies tier 1, so a tier-2 change appears in the highlights AND in the internal
# note -- and until now that was implied by two differently-suffixed keys ('Significance' and
# 'SignificanceConsumer') that a reader had to know were audiences. As rows it is literal: the rows an
# entry has ARE the documents it appears in, and each row's number is that document's reader answering
# their own question. Filling in two rows is no longer a second judgement bolted on; it is saying out loud
# that the change reaches two audiences, which is what tier 2 already meant.
#
# IT REPLACES THE 'Tier: N' LINE rather than joining it, because the row states the tier and the same fact
# in two places is the drift this repo has paid for repeatedly. THE TIER COLUMN IS NOT THAT DUPLICATION:
# once folded, the changelog SECTION states how far the change reaches, while the column says which
# audience each SCORE belongs to. Two different jobs on the same number, which is why the table survives
# the fold whole where the old 'Tier:' line was consumed by it.
#
# 'Tier: N' IS STILL READ, AND ALWAYS WILL BE -- "recognise both, write one", this repo's standing rule
# for a format change. Entries written before this table exist are already in CHANGELOG.md and in every
# consumer's tree, and a parser that only knew the new shape would read every one of them as tier 0:
# silent, correct-looking, and wrong in the direction that empties a release. So an entry with no table
# falls back to the old line, with no score -- which is exactly what those entries have.
#
# THE FORWARD-LOOKING FRAMEWORKS DELIBERATELY DO NOT APPLY HERE, and it is worth saying so, because they
# are the first thing anyone reaches for. RICE and WSJF price work BEFORE it is done and carry effort in
# the denominator -- they answer "what do we build next". Everything scored here is already merged, so
# effort is spent and irrelevant; the only open question is how much the reader of a finished release
# document gets out of what landed. That is a magnitude, not a priority. Reach and significance is the
# same decomposition incident practice makes when it derives a priority from impact and urgency rather
# than asking for one number.
#
# IT WAS CALLED 'Happiness' FOR ONE AFTERNOON (Dave, August 5, 2026). He rejected the word as
# unprofessional and he was right about more than the word: 'happiness' names an EMOTION in the reader,
# which is not something an entry's author is in any position to assert. What they can judge is the weight
# of the change for that audience, which is what the field always measured. Renamed before it shipped;
# nothing carries the old key.
#
# 1 TO 5 AGAINST A WRITTEN RUBRIC (Get-EntrySignificanceRubric below), and the rubric is what makes this a
# measurement rather than a mood. An unanchored ordinal scale invites false precision -- the difference
# between a 3 and a 4 becomes whatever the author felt that morning -- and this repo asked for the
# opposite. Every level therefore has a definition, in the same shape severity levels, CVSS qualitative
# bands and ITIL impact levels use: a test a reader can apply to somebody else's entry and get the same
# answer. That also makes the number COMPARABLE ACROSS RELEASES, which an unanchored one could not be: a 5
# means "the reader must act" in August and in June alike, because the rubric says so rather than the
# release's own spread.
#
# Dave chose the rubric over an unanchored scale on August 5, 2026, reversing his own earlier answer the
# same day once the naming question exposed what was behind it. Recorded because the reversal IS the
# reasoning: the first answer avoided calibration on the grounds that every anchor is a second judgement
# that can drift, which is true and is the price. Without anchors there is no judgement to drift and also
# nothing to check, and an unauditable ranking published beside a release is the thing being avoided.
#
# THE 'Why' COLUMN IS REQUIRED, and the rubric does not replace it. The level says which band the change
# falls in; the why says why THIS change is in that band, which is the half a later reader can disagree
# with. It travels into the record and is never published outward -- see Remove-EntryImpactTable.
#
# NO SCAFFOLDED NUMBER, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE CHOICE FROM THE OLD TIER DEFAULT, AND DELIBERATE. 'Tier: 0'
# had a default because 0 is a legitimate, harmless final answer -- forgetting it under-promotes, which is
# loud at the cut. A significance score has no harmless value: any number written for the author would be
# a GUESS, and this repo has measured what a guessed ranking costs. The retired highlights marker guessed
# from the branch prefix which changes a consumer would notice and put v3.2.0's single most consequential
# change -- renaming the marketplace, which breaks every existing install -- below the line, because it
# arrived on a chore/ branch. So the scaffold writes the tier-0 row and nothing else, and the cut refuses a
# release whose entries have not answered.
#
# THE HEADERS ARE NOT REPO-OWNED, for the reason the old labels were not: they are the machine-read keys
# four scripts must agree on, the same class as 'Plugins:', and the language rule keeps a technical
# identifier in its original form. WHETHER a repo ranks at all IS repo-owned (Test-EntrySignificanceActive),
# and so is the RUBRIC's wording (Get-EntrySignificanceRubric) -- the editorial half, not the key.

        REPO-OWNED VIA Get-EntrySignificanceRubricLevels, probed with Get-Command like every other prose
        knob in this file (#410's class). A rubric is the one part of this mechanism a repo genuinely
        might have to differ on: "the reader must act" means something different to a marketplace than to
        a storefront, and a repo whose consumers are non-technical needs its own wording. The HEADERS stay
        fixed while the rubric moves, which is the right split -- the key is machine-read, the definition
        is editorial.

        The override is accepted as a hashtable or ordered dictionary keyed by score, because that is the
        natural way to write one in a config file -- but it is read with GetEnumerator, never the indexer,
        for the reason in the comment above the defaults. A level the override omits keeps its built-in
        text rather than leaving a hole, so a repo can retune one band without restating five; a level
        whose override is empty is ignored, the same fail-safe Get-EntryScaffoldWording uses, because a
        blank rubric would make a gate print nothing exactly where it promises the definitions.

        the entry failed rather than only that it failed). A gate that says "write a number from 1 to 5"

        Does this repo rank its entries at all? $true unless it says otherwise.

        THE SECTION-COUNT HEURISTIC DIED WITH THE SECTIONS (August 5, 2026), and replacing it was not
        optional. This used to answer "off where there is no tier split", reading the changelog's section map
        and treating one section as "this repo never adopted tiers". That test had a real basis while the map
        existed -- the sections WERE the repo's declaration of which tiers it files. The flat changelog has no
        map -- and the resolver that read it is retired further down this file -- so keeping the old line
        would have read every repo as not ranking: the scaffold's table, both validators
        and the cut's significance gate would all have switched themselves off, silently, in the same commit
        that made the ranking the document's only ordering. Nothing would have errored.

        SO THE DEFAULT IS ON, WITH AN EXPLICIT OPT-OUT, which is also the consistent answer: the entry's
        section structure became unconditional in the same change, on the grounds that two entry shapes in one
        system need both paths in every reader forever. A repo that has not adopted the model is not harmed by
        being on -- its entries are tier 0, and tier 0 is asked for no score (Get-EntryImpactFindings), so
        every gate stays quiet by itself rather than by a flag.

        The seam is Get-EntrySignificanceEnabled in the consumer's scripts/repo-config.ps1, probed with
        Get-Command like every other optional knob. Returning $false there switches off the scaffold's table,
        both validators and the cut's gate together, because a half-adopted ranking (required but never read)
        is worse than neither. It does NOT switch off the fold's ORDERING: with the sections gone that
        ordering is what the three headings used to say, so it is structure rather than a preference.

        Test-ReleaseBumpEarned's own Active flag in release-lib.ps1 keys off the same retired section map and
        needs the same repair; it is left to the change that reworks the release side, because the answer
        there is about which release documents exist rather than about scoring.

        carries it. RAISING THE TIER IS ADDING A ROW, so the rows an entry has are the claims it makes and
        there is no way to claim a reach without also saying what it is worth there.

                    'Tier: N' line carried. 0 when nothing usable is declared, so a caller that ignores
                    Error still fails safe towards the harmless end rather than crashing.
          Declared  $true when the reach was actually stated (a table with rows, or a 'Tier:' line).
          Errors    every row-level complaint, ready to print; empty when the table parses.

        FALLS BACK TO 'Tier: N', and that fallback is not legacy tolerance -- it is correctness for the
        entries that already exist. Every entry in CHANGELOG.md and in every consumer's tree predates this
        table, and reading them as tier 0 would silently empty a release. So no table means: read the old
        line, report no scores, and let the gates decide whether scores were required.

        FENCE-AWARE, AND THE FIRST TABLE OUTSIDE A FENCE WINS. An entry documenting this mechanism quotes
        the table inside a fence -- the entry for this very change does, and so does this file -- and a
        parser that cannot tell a quote from a declaration gets disabled by whoever hits it first.

        A ROW'S FAULTS ARE REPORTED, NOT ABSORBED, the same choice Resolve-EntryTier made and for the same
        failure: a '| 2 | 9 | ... |' that silently read back as unscored would sink the entry to the bottom
        of the document it matters most in, with correct-looking output and nothing to notice.

        Empty means the entry has said everything its own reach commits it to.

        ONE FUNCTION FOR BOTH GATES, and that is the whole reason it exists rather than living in one of
        them. open-pr.ps1 needs it while the branch is still the only thing affected, and cut-release.ps1
        needs it because a missing score is Dave's chosen refusal point (August 5, 2026) -- the branch may
        merge without one, the release may not be cut. Two gates, one definition of "wrong", or they drift
        and the earlier one starts passing what the later one refuses.

        THE LADDER IS CHECKED AS A LADDER. An entry claiming tier 2 appears in the highlights AND in the
        internal note, so it owes a row for tier 1 as well -- and being asked for it is the point rather
        than a chore, because "reaches consumers" without "and here is what colleagues get out of it" is
        half a claim. Every tier from 1 up to the declared reach needs a row, a score and a why.

        TIER 0 OWES NOTHING. It appears only in the record, which is complete and chronological and never
        sorted, so there is no position for a score to decide.

        AN ENTRY WITH NO TABLE AT ALL IS NOT FAULTED FOR THAT, only for what its tier then requires. That
        keeps every pre-table entry in CHANGELOG.md readable rather than retroactively broken -- but it does
        NOT excuse a tier-1 entry from having a score, because the ranking has to be able to place it.

        WHERE THIS RUNS, AND WHERE IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. The table survives the FOLD whole whenever any
        row carries a score, because the cut EMPTIES the changelog's tier sections -- a score consumed at
        the fold would not exist when the release documents are built days later, and the ordering could not
        be reproduced without re-estimating it. The record therefore keeps the table, and the development
        notes are the last place each ranking's justification survives.

        THE DOCUMENTS THAT TRAVEL OUTWARD STRIP IT: the highlights, the per-plugin CHANGELOGs and the
        release cards. A self-assigned number printed at a consumer is a marketing claim, and this repo has
        measured what a published guess costs -- the retired highlights marker is in release-lib's history
        for exactly that. The number does its work by deciding the order and then gets out of the way.

        The fold also calls it for an UNSCORED table -- a tier-0 entry's scaffold row, which is a question
        nobody was asked rather than content -- so such an entry folds clean.

        Fence-aware, and only the FIRST table is removed, exactly like Remove-EntryTierLine and for the case
        that arrived immediately: the entry documenting this mechanism quotes the table inside a fence, and a
        blind matcher would delete it out of the fence while rendering.

function Get-ImpactInsertOffset {
    <#
        Pure: where in a changelog tier SECTION a new entry with $Score belongs -- a character offset into
        $SectionText, always at an entry boundary ('### ' at line start) or at its very end.

        THE FOLD IS WHAT KEEPS CHANGELOG.md ORDERED, and it has to be, because the cut EMPTIES the tier
        sections. There is no later moment at which the pending list could be sorted: the release documents
        read the section in document order, so whatever order the fold leaves behind IS the order the notes
        and the highlights inherit. That is also what makes the ordering reproducible across the two moments
        days apart, with nothing re-estimated -- the numbers are read from the file both times, and the
        second reader does not sort at all.

        INSERT-ONLY, NEVER A RE-SORT, and that is a safety property rather than an optimisation. This
        function serves a commit that lands DIRECTLY ON THE MAIN BRANCH under one of this repo's two named
        exceptions. A re-sort would have the fold rewrite the position of entries it did not write, so a bug
        could scramble a section; an insert can only ever misplace the one entry being folded, which is
        visible in the diff and one edit to repair.

        HIGHEST FIRST, AND A TIE KEEPS THE NEWER ENTRY ON TOP. The list is written newest-first, so equal
        ranks preserve exactly what the fold did before ranking existed.

        AN UNSCORED ENTRY ($Score 0 -- a tier-0 entry, one from before the table, or a repo with the ranking
        off) SINKS TO THE BOTTOM OF ITS OWN TIER, and that is a reversal of what this function did when it
        was written: it had an early return sending any score of 0 to the top of the section. The reason it
        had to go is symmetry with the entries it ranks against. The loop below reads an entry ALREADY in the
        changelog that declares no score as 0 and therefore sorts it below everything scored at its tier -- so
        the early return meant the SAME entry ranked differently depending on which side of the fold it was
        on, top while it was being inserted and bottom forever after. 0 is the lowest rank, not the absence of
        one. Nothing is lost by sinking: open-pr reports a missing score and the cut refuses over it by name.

        RANKED ON (TIER, SIGNIFICANCE) SINCE THE SECTIONS WENT (Dave, August 5, 2026). While CHANGELOG.md had
        one section per tier, the section answered "how far" and this only had to order within it. There is one
        flat list now, so the tier is the FIRST key: consumer-facing work leads, repo-internal work sinks, and
        the significance decides the order inside each tier. That is what the three section headings used to
        communicate visually, kept as an ordering rather than as structure.

        $EntryPattern is the heading shape an entry starts with -- '(?m)^## ' for the current format. It is a
        parameter rather than a constant because a document mid-migration still holds pre-format '### '
        entries, and the caller knows which it is looking at.

    # DECLARING TIER 0 IS NOT THE SAME AS DECLARING NOTHING, and conflating them was a real bug here: an
    # early return sent everything with tier 0 and no score to the TOP of the list, so a repo-internal change
    # led the document. There WAS an -Undeclared switch for that second case, returning the top; it is gone,
    # because in a flat list there is no such thing as an unplaced entry. An entry that declares nothing is
    # tier 0 -- the documented default and the harmless end -- and the loop below already lands it at the top
    # of the tier-0 run, which is the newest-first answer without promoting it past work that declared more.
    # Keeping a switch no caller passes would have preserved the wrong answer for the day somebody reached

    # FENCE-AWARE, LIKE EVERY OTHER READER OF THIS FORMAT -- and this function was the one that was not.
    # Measured on the fold of PR #477, in the document PR #476 had just created: that entry quotes
    # '## #475 <midDot> ...' inside a ```text fence, as the worked example of the format it introduces. A
    # plain regex over the text reads that quoted heading as an entry boundary, which does two things and
    # neither errors:
    #
    #   * it SPLITS the real entry in two. The fragment above the fence holds no impact table -- the table
    #     sits further down, under '### Who is this for' -- so it reads as tier 0, score 0;
    #   * the loop below then meets that tier-0 fragment FIRST, and any entry of tier 1 or higher is
    #     inserted above it: at the very top of the document. Which is what happened -- a tier-1 entry led
    #     a list whose next six entries were tier 2.
    #
    # Well-formed markdown either way, and the console line even reported it ("placed above 8 existing
    # entries" in a document that had 7). The fourth-plus instance of one defect class in this file's

# --- The entry's own shape: one H2 per change, with named sections ---------------------------------
#
# ONE HEADING PER CHANGE, AND THE DOCUMENT HAS NO OTHERS (Dave, August 5, 2026). CHANGELOG.md used to open
# with '## Latest Release' and three '## Tier N - Pull Requests' sections, with each change an '### ' inside
# one of them. All four are gone. A change IS the '## ' heading now -- '## #475 <midDot> A significance score
# per entry' -- and inside it three named '### ' sections answer the three questions a reader actually
# arrives with:
#
#   ### What does this change do?    the description, which used to be a bare paragraph under the heading
#   ### Who is this for              the impact table -- the tiers this change reaches, each with a score
#   ### Type of change               Feat / Fix / Docs / Chore, which used to be a middot field in the heading
#
# WHY THE TYPE MOVED OUT OF THE HEADING. It was the second-to-last middot field, then (when the merge date
# left) a field matched by content against the known branch types. Both were parses of a heading that was
# doing three jobs at once. As its own section it is stated rather than inferred, and the heading is reduced
# to what a reader scans: the PR number and the title.
#
# WHY 'Who is this for' IS THE TABLE AND NOT PROSE BESIDE IT. The table's Tier rows already answer exactly
# that question, and answering it twice is the duplication this repo has paid for repeatedly. So the heading
# names the question and the table is the answer.
#
# THE HEADINGS ARE REPO-OWNED, unlike the impact table's column keys. That split follows the one this file
# already makes: a machine-read KEY stays fixed ('Tier', 'Significance', 'Plugins:'), while text a reader
# SEES belongs to the repo that owns the document -- the same #410 reasoning that made the entry stubs and
# the category labels configurable. These are read back by the parser, so a repo that translates them
# translates both halves at once, which is why they come from one resolver rather than being written twice.

        function of that name, and a same-named reader would be replaced by the config's version the moment
        it is dot-sourced -- the collision this file documents on $RepoRoot/$repoRoot, one scope up.

        An override that is present but EMPTY is ignored, the same fail-safe Get-EntryScaffoldWording uses.
        A blank heading would make the parser look for '### ' with nothing after it, which matches the start
        of every section in the document -- so the type reader would return the first section's body and the
        entry would be filed under a type nobody wrote.

        VALIDATED AGAINST THE REPO'S OWN BRANCH TYPES where those are reachable (Get-BranchTypes, which the
        callers dot-source for other reasons). A type the repo does not produce is reported rather than
        absorbed: the release documents group nothing by it any more, but a typo'd type still reaches the
        record and the per-plugin changelogs, where nobody looks again.

        THE FIRST LINE IS THE TYPE, and anything after it is ignored rather than refused. 'Feat' with a
        sentence of justification under it is a reasonable thing to write, and refusing it would make the

        FALLS BACK TO THE HEADING for an entry written before this format -- '### Title <midDot> Feat' or the
        older '### Title <midDot> Feat <midDot> 2026-08-03'. Every entry in this repo's history and in every

# --- RETIRED, AUGUST 5, 2026: the changelog's tier sections ---------------------------------------
#
# $script:DefaultChangelogHeading, Resolve-ChangelogTierSections and Get-ChangelogTierSections answered
# one question -- which '## ' heading a merged entry is filed under -- for the three readers that had to
# agree about it: the fold, release-lib's parser and the release cut. CHANGELOG.md has no section
# headings any more. An entry IS an H2 and the document is an intro plus a ranked list of them, so the
# question has no subject: there is no heading to name, and therefore nothing for three readers to
# disagree about.
#
# WHAT REPLACED IT IS NOT A DIFFERENT ANSWER BUT A STRUCTURAL ONE. The fold derives the intro/list
# boundary from the first entry heading (Get-EntryHeadingLevel), and release-lib's Split-Changelog does
# the same. Both are exact-level matches, which is safe for the reason Get-EntryHeadingPattern there
# spells out: '^##' followed by whitespace cannot match an entry's own '### ' sections.
#
# THE SEAMS GO WITH THEM: Get-ChangelogTierHeadings and the older single-section Get-ChangelogHeading
# (issue #178) in the consumer's scripts/repo-config.ps1 are no longer read by anything. A consumer that
# still defines either is unaffected -- nothing calls them, so they are dead code in that repo's seam,
# and its next fold and cut behave exactly as this repo's do.
#
# Test-EntrySignificanceActive above used to infer "does this repo rank" from the number of sections this
# returned, and that is the one place the retirement was NOT a pure deletion; see its header for why the
# default had to become on rather than off.

function Test-EntryDeclaresShape {
    <#
        Pure: does this block actually look like an ENTRY? $true when it declares its named sections (any
        one of the three headings, outside fences) or a change type (the Type section, or the pre-format
        type field in its heading, via Resolve-EntryType).

        WHY THIS EXISTS, AND IT IS A MEASURED CONSUMER DEFECT RATHER THAN TIDINESS (August 5, 2026). With
        the changelog flat, every '## ' below the intro is read as one change. A consumer whose CHANGELOG.md
        still carries the pre-flat shape has section headings at exactly that level -- '## Pull Requests',
        '## Tier 2 - Pull Requests', '## Releases' -- and the updated shared scripts reach them through a
        plugin update rather than by their choosing. Measured against both shapes:

          * the single-section consumer: '## Pull Requests' parses as ONE entry swallowing all of their real
            entries, and '## Releases' as a second one -- so their entire release history is published into
            the release notes and the per-plugin CHANGELOGs as a "change", and then DELETED from
            CHANGELOG.md, because the cut keeps only the intro;
          * the consumer who had adopted the tier sections: three entries named after the three headings.

        AND NOTHING REFUSED. Every one of those blocks declares no impact, so Test-ReleaseBumpEarned reads
        the repo as never having adopted the model and reports itself INACTIVE -- correctly, by its own
        rule -- which means the release proceeds. Silent, correct-looking, and it loses data.

        SO THE PARSER REFUSES INSTEAD, and this predicate is the test it refuses on. The discriminator is
        exact rather than a heuristic: the format has two legitimate shapes and both declare something. A
        current entry carries the three named sections; a pre-format entry carries its type as a heading
        field, which is what new-changelog-entry.ps1 wrote for as long as that shape existed. A leftover
        section heading carries neither, and cannot -- it is a heading with prose under it.

        Deliberately NOT keyed on the '#NN' the fold prepends: the fold cannot reach gh on a manual merge
        and then writes a legitimate entry with no number, saying so on the console. A gate keying on the
        number would report the fold's own documented output as a defect.

        FENCE-AWARE through the readers it calls, for the reason every reader here is: an entry documenting
        this format quotes these headings inside a fence, and the entry for this very change does.

        Pure: given an entry file's text, returns the scaffold markers it still contains -- an array of
        objects with Marker (the literal string found) and Label (which of the three it is). Empty array
        means the entry has been written rather than merely scaffolded.

        WHY A SUBSTRING MATCH AND NOT A WHOLE-LINE ONE. The measured case (v3.2.0, three entries) was
        not an untouched scaffold: the author kept the body heading and appended a status behind it --
        "**To do / where I left off:** done -- lint gate green". That is a progress note, and it read as
        one in the release notes and in the per-plugin CHANGELOGs that travel to consumers. A whole-line
        match would have passed all three.

        FENCED CODE IS EXCLUDED, for the same reason the entry-heading check excludes it: an entry may
        legitimately quote the scaffold inside a fence while documenting this very mechanism -- this
        repo's own docs do -- and a guard that cannot tell a quote from the real thing gets disabled.
